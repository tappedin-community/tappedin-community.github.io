<h1>About Tapped In</h1>

<a name="vision"></a>
<h2>Vision: Transforming Teacher Professional Development Online</h2>

<p>Research has shown that student achievement is directly linked to teacher quality. State and national
teaching standards provide a framework for teachers' professional growth that requires teachers to
engage in ongoing professional development throughout their careers. The increasing demand for
continuous professional development means that providers must expand face-to-face programs to
include online activities and content that engage teachers anytime, anywhere. The growing
recognition that no single organization can satisfy teachers' ongoing professional development
needs requires that educators and providers form communities to share strategies, resources, and
support. Tapped In was developed to support this vision. </p>

<p>Tapped In was created by SRI International to transform teacher
professional development (TPD) for professional development providers and educators. Tapped In
enables providers to offer high-quality online professional development experiences and support
to more teachers cost-effectively. Through Tapped In, educators can extend their professional
growth beyond courses or workshops with the online tools, resources, colleagues, and support
they need to implement effective, classroom-centered learning activities. </p>


<a name="services"></a>
<h2>Tenant Services: Enabling TPD Providers to Meet Their Goals</h2>

<p>Tapped In offered TPD providers and other organizations the latest in online technology, along with the online learning
strategies and support needed to use online technology effectively. Through Tapped In, organizations
developed, implemented, and managed online courses, workshops, seminars, mentoring
programs, and other collaborative activities that supplemented, or functioned in lieu of, face-to-face
activities. Tapped In experts worked with organization staff to design and facilitate online activities
that are motivating, standards based, and attuned to the learning styles and technical facility
of participating teachers. We helped organizations address the dual challenges of sustained follow-up
support and scaling-up services to reach all who need them. Organizations also benefited from the
resources and expertise of other tenant partners that participated
in the Tapped In community.</p>

<p>Online activities took place within custom virtual buildings within the Tapped In environment.
Each organization received their own building, which typically had 3 floors:
<ol>
  <li>A ground floor with a reception (where members find help desk staff and news) and other public rooms
  (conference rooms, etc.). </li>
  <li>A second floor with group rooms, which can be open to the public, moderated,
  or totally private. Group owners can assign moderators and permissions to group members.</li>
  <li>A third floor with personal offices for members affiliated with the organization.</li>
</ol>

<p><p>Tapped In currently supports the activities of the following teacher professional development,
pre-service, master's degree programs, and state and local education agencies, as well as scores
of small local groups from around the globe.</p>

<h2>Educator Activities: A Career-Long Online Home</h2>

<p>Tapped In brought educators together both locally and worldwide to cultivate a community that
supports each teacher as a professional. We built the capacity of teachers to support one
another through peer networks supported by the Tapped In community. Educators could
<ul>
  <li>Plan and conduct learning projects with colleagues and students.</li>
  <li>Participate in or lead topical discussion and groups.</li>
  <li>Manage and attend online courses offered by TPD providers.</li>
  <li>Mentor other educators.</li>
  <li>Try out new ideas in a safe, supportive environment.</li>
</ul>
Resources, experts, mentors, and new colleagues were available to all. Collectively, these
elements of Tapped In formed a uniquely supportive, career-long online home for education
professionals.</p>
