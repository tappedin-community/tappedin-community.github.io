<p><b><span class="standard">Tapped In 2 Demo</span></b></p>
<p><span class="standard">This demo illustrates some of the proposed functionality 
  for Tapped In 2, in the context of a sample user scenario that combines elements 
  of multiple scenarios developed by the TI2 team. More work is yet to be done 
  in collaboration with our interaction designer on the final layout of some elements, 
  but we hope that this walk through will give you a better feeling for the functionality 
  and interaction of the proposed system. Comments and suggestions are welcome!</span></p>
<p><span class="standard">The scenario takes place over a several week period 
  as a teacher, Elaine, joins Tappedin In and interacts with the system. As you 
  read about a particular week, click on the first link you see. A new window 
  should pop up with the interface that Elaine would be seeing. As you continue 
  to read the scenario, follow the instructions <font color="#FF0033">[in red 
  brackets] </font>to click on a indicated part of the interface. If something 
  unexpected happens or something doesn't seem to work, check that you followed 
  the scenario script closely. If you stray off of the script or change the order 
  in which you click on things (e.g., open the chat before it says to do so) some 
  things may not work. In the interest of time, we did not elaborate all possibilities 
  in this hard-coded demo, but rather focused on a linear path through the demo 
  that follows a specific scenario. </span> </p>
<p><b><span class="standard">Scenario</span></b></p>
<p><span class="standard">Elaine Marquez is a fifth grade emergency permit teacher 
  just beginning her first year of teaching. She feels discouraged by her lack 
  of skill in classroom management and at a loss about how to teach reading to 
  her fifth grade students--many of whom are English Language Learners. She learned 
  about TAPPED IN through a presentation at the CUE conference. She is also in 
  a LACOE member (Los Angeles County Office of Education), and some of her colleagues 
  recommended TAPPED IN to her.</span> </p>
<p><span class="standard"><b>Week 0, Signup scenario (not shown in the demo)</b></span></p>
<p><span class="standard">Elaine signs up with TAPPED IN as a member of LACOE. 
  She sets up a virtual office with high hopes of creating online conversations 
  with colleagues and experts. </span></p>
<p><b class="standard">Week 1: Trying chat and PM scenario</b></p>
<p><span class="standard">Elaine <a href="login.html" target="_blank">logs in</a> 
  to meet with her friends Chris and Judi. <font color="#FF0033">[Click the login 
  button]</font> Chris and Judi are in her office, waiting for her. She sends 
  Chris a private message that she can't make their scheduled lunch next Wednesday, 
  but maybe they can meet on Thursday. <font color="#FF0033">[Click the face icon 
  beside chris_brown to see the PM field]</font>. They all talk for half an hour, 
  and toward the end, Elaine shows them some new reading and literacy links that 
  she has found by projecting some web sites to them.<font color="#FF0033"> [Click 
  on the Actions menu to see the Project URL command]</font>. <br>
  <br>
  They end their discussion, and Elaine decides to go into &quot;unavailable&quot; 
  mode so that she can't be disturbed. <font color="#FF0033">[Click on Become 
  Unavailable in the Actions menu]. </font>She is interested in learning more 
  about TAPPED IN, so she reads more about what it has to offer. <font color="#FF0033">[Click 
  on the TAPPED IN tab at the top]</font>. She then decides to explore her office 
  some more.<font color="#FF0033"> [Click on the Room View button]</font>. She 
  added a few items to it last week, but wants to learn more about what she can 
  do here. <font color="#FF0033"> [Click on various room navigation links on the 
  left]</font>. She loves that she has an online calendar, and can store files 
  and links her and share them with others who visit. <font color="#FF0033"> [Close 
  demo]</font></span></p>
<p><span class="standard"><b>Week 2: Finding and joining groups and courses scenario</b></span></p>
<p><span class="standard">Elaine wants to get together with others and expand 
  her knowledge of the learning and teaching of reading. Since she is familiar 
  with LACOE, she decides to start by browsing LACOE's offerings in TAPPED IN. 
  </span></p>
<p><span class="standard">From <a href="rooms/officeframeset.html" target="_blank">her 
  office</a>, Elaine looks to see what groups LACOE sponsors in TAPPED IN. <font color="#FF0033">[Click 
  the LACOE tab, then click the Group sub-tab in the subnavigation]</font>. There 
  she sees (among other listings) the STELLAR Learning Group (Supporting Teachers 
  of English Learners in Language and Reading). <font color="#FF0033">[Click the 
  STELLAR Learning Group link]</font>. The description of the group mentions an 
  associated course. She's been thinking about taking a course, so she looks at 
  the STELLAR course to get more information. <font color="#FF0033">[Click the 
  STELLAR Course link]</font>. She reads the course description, and decides to 
  sign up for the course, so she applied to enroll. <font color="#FF0033">[Click 
  the Apply to Enroll button]</font>. A message is displayed that tells her that 
  her request has been submitted and she will get an email from the course instructor 
  shortly. </span></p>
<p><span class="standard">Elaine wonders what other groups in TAPPED IN might 
  focus on reading and literacy. She could browse the TAPPED IN tab offerings, 
  but thinks a search might be faster, since there are probably a lot of groups 
  in this community. <font color="#FF0033">[Click the Search tab, and then click 
  the Group sub-tab in the subnavigation]</font>. In the search field, she enters 
  "reading literacy&quot; and submits the search. <font color="#FF0033">[Click 
  the Find It button]</font>. In the result list, she notices the STELLAR group 
  again, among others, and then sees the BASRC Literacy Learning Group. Elaine 
  has heard of BASRC, so she decides to learn more about it. <font color="#FF0033">[Click 
  the BASRC Literacy Learning group link]</font>. She reads about the group, and 
  notices that it is open to anyone so she decides to join.<font color="#FF0033"> 
  [Click the Join Group button]</font>. A message is displayed telling her that 
  she is now a member, and that next group meeting is next Tuesday at 5 pm. <font color="#FF0033">[Close 
  demo]</font>.</span></p>
<p><span class="standard"><b>Week 3: Interacting with the Me tab and a group, 
  and downloading files</b></span></p>
<p><span class="standard">Elaine logs in a few minutes before 5 pm on Tuesday 
  for her first BASRC Literacy Learning Group meeting.</span></p>
<p><span class="standard">She wants to leave <a href="rooms/officeframeset.html" target="_blank">her 
  office</a> to go to her first group meeting. She remembers that her groups are 
  listed under her Me tab. <font color="#FF0033">[Click the Me tab]</font>. She 
  notices that there are a couple of saved private messages there from her friend 
  Nieko, and makes a note to read them later, since the group meeting is about 
  to start. She looks under Groups, sees the BASRC group, and goes to the group 
  room. <font color="#FF0033">[Click the Group sub-tab in the subnavigation, then 
  the BASRC group link]</font>. She sees that several people are in the group 
  room already. They introduce themselves to each other. Elaine remembers that 
  she wanted to tell her friend Neika about the group, so she look on her Buddies 
  list, finds Neika, and sends her a private message. <font color="#FF0033">[Click 
  the Buddies tab, then click on the face icon beside neika_wood]</font>. Neika 
  isn't online right now, but she'll see the message in her Saved Messages list 
  the next time she logs in. </span></p>
<p><span class="standard">The group leader, Derrick, arrives and announces that 
  today they will be talking about a sample assessment rubric. Derrick asks everyone 
  if they have Adobe Acrobat to read PDF files; if not, they can download the 
  Reader for free from adobe.com. They all have Acrobat already. He asks everyone 
  to download the Sample Rubric 1 from the Featured Items list. Elaine clicks 
  on the file and it downloads to her computer. <font color="#FF0033">[Click the 
  Sample Rubric 1 link in the Featured items list]</font>. Like most web browsers, 
  her browser recognizes the PDF file type an opens the file automatically for 
  her in Acrobat. Elaine skims the document as the discussion continues. <font color="#FF0033">[Close 
  demo]</font></span></p>
