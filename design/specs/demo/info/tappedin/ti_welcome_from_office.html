      <p><span class="standard"> Tapped In is the online workplace of an international 
        community of education professionals. K-12 teachers and librarians, professional 
        development staff, teacher education faculty and students, and researchers 
        engaged in professional development programs and informal collaborative 
        activities with colleagues. </span></p>
      <p><span class="standard">Tapped In is comprised of virtual &quot;rooms&quot; 
        for courses, groups and individuals. Each room comes with communication 
        tools (e.g., chat, private messaging, discussion boards) and support tools 
        (e.g., file sharing, web links, calendars) to help you quickly and effectively 
        plan and conduct online activities. In addition, directory tabs (like 
        this one) allow you to easily access a directory of information about 
        members, places, courses, groups, files, etc. available to all Tapped 
        In members (the Tapped In tab), to members of particular &quot;tenant&quot; 
        organizations, or just to you (the Me tab). Even when you're looking at 
        an information tab like this, you are still in a room, and can continue 
        talking with people in that room. The room that you are in is always listed 
        at the top left, below the Tapped In logo. </span></p>
