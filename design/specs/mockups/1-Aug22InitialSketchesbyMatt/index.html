Initial Sketches by Matt
<!--#include virtual="/archive/ti2design/includes/endtitle.inc"-->

<p>The TAPPED IN team met and discussed this first pass with Matt today. We decided to (a) not assume that the chat frame is always visible, (b) make the default info you see when you log in be announcements about what is new (new messages, files, course notes, etc. for you) on the right, and your navigation bar (left) and (c) make the room graphic fade (either light background, or small icon, or some kind of frame around content; not sure). Matt is incorporating our comments and will have another set of sketches soon.</p>
