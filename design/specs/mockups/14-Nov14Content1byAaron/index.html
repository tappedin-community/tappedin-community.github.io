<p>Sounds like the latest iteration is at a point now where we can begin to move into the "content" for rooms, information screens, documents, courses, etc.  Shweew...</p>
<p>I've made a couple minor changes to the interface, mostly to accommodate this content.</p>
<p>The idea would be that the interior room map is shown only on the first "what's here" screen; from then on out, you can get back to that view via a bread crumb navigation in the top left (right now it's just at " : what's here").  Obviously, things will get more complicated for group and course rooms, but I wanted to start out simple for the time being for the sake of time.</p>

<h4>Patti</h4>

<p>I like it! Larry does too (says it "looks very cool"). He says the difference between place and information is more apparent to him now.</p>
<p>Minor Question 1: the breadcrumb says NCMSC Suite:  Whats Here. Are those one link or two? They take you do the same place, right?</p>
<p>Minor Question 2: the little sound waves by Mark and Patricia in the Who's Here list are dark blue and the rest are gray. Is that a way of signifying level of participation, or something else? (I guess we could look for which people haven't said anything for the last X minutes and turn their sound waves gray...)</p>

<p>Answers to your questions...<br>Minor Question 1: Yes, the same place, but I think it's important to set up a consistent pattern from the get go.</p></p>Minor Question 2: These indicate whether someone has chat collapsed or open (are they live or not?)  Maybe if your name is there too at the top of the list and there's an indicator reflecting your state, it will be more obvious (like in IM).</p>

<h4>Tapped In Crew</h4> 

<p>Mark, Judi, Zaz and I just met for about an hour and went over the last iteration you did. Overall we like it; here are just a few thoughts we wanted reaction to.</p><p>On the top:<br>
- Can we change "My Stuff" to \"Me\" ? Zaz and Judi in particular have trouble with this, and Me seemed like the best compromise we came up with (since it's more parallel to Tapped In and NCREL).<br>
- Can you add a little more space between the Tapped In and Help tabs, maybe move Help and Search over to the right a little? It reminds us of a tooth gap now, and we thought a tad more space would be better and would emphasize the difference a little more.<br>
- could we add a tiny padlock image by the room name (to the right? dunno...) that is visible to everyone in the room, and the owner (only) can click on it to toggle the locked/unlocked state to let others in or keep them out.</p>
<p>
On the information tabs:<br>
- On the Me/Tappedin/NCREL subtabs, where it says Favorites (said Resources iteraton 11) can we change this to "Files & Links"? Unless you can think of a better name... Favorites doesn't really make sense since under Me *everything* is (implicitly) your favorites, but you need to know where your files and links are and they aren't showing;  resources is what we meant by files and links before but that seems to vague.</p>
(to be continued...) 

<h4>Tapped In Crew</h4>

<p>On the room tabs:<br>
- Can we add some more tabs, so that the subnav for each room looks like so:<br>
What's Here<br>
Calendar<br>
Discussion<br>
Files & Links<br>
Passageways<br>
Settings  (only the owner would see this tab)</p>

<p>Every room will have at least this stuff, we think. </p>
<p>In the content of the What's Here area:<br>
- We like the room drawing and description on the left like you have it. <br>
- On the right, can we show links to all of the subnav items (Calendar, Discussion, File&Links, Passageways; Settings maybe...), since they're all there in that room? We could put a short sentence by each saying what they are, if necessary, though that might be obvious. We thought under Settings, the owner could specify whether or not particular files & links they make public should show up under What's Here, or if you need to click on Files & Links to see them. That is, a What's Here page would (redundantly, we know) have links to all the subnav items plus show the special files or URLs that the owner wanted to "promote" to the What's Here page. The owner decide in Settings what files and links they want to show in What's Here (e.g., all files or only certain ones); by default it *could* be all (dunno what the best default would be) but if they have bazillions of files they could just selectively show the one or two they want to highlight under What's Here; you'd have to click on File & Links to see all of the room owner's public files & links.</p>

<p>Chat Area:<br>
- We need to talk about this more; it's really close, but we're not sure the buttons that are there (Save Text, Project URL, Whiteboard) are really the ones we want. We don't see major changes but these buttons may change, stay tuned...</p>

<p>Does this make sense? Tell us if you think any of these ideas are bad (and why...)</p>
