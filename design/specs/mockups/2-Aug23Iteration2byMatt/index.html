Iteration 2 by Matt

<p>Matt's next pass at sketches. We focused on 3 issues in our meeting: how to indicate to the user that they can get info or chat or IM someone, more options for search, and show how file upload would happen. People info: one option would be to put tiny icons by people's names in the WHO list, one for info, one for chat, one for IM (microphone?). Need to watch out for icon proliferation though. Gray out icons if the person isn't in chat or doesn't want others to IM them. For search, we talked about checkboxes that the user could select from to search over files, individuals, groups, courses, urls, status (online or offline right now), mentors. For files, we talked about looking at how Yahoo does file upload and how it displays filenames. We don't want to require javascript or java; simple text is fine. </p>
