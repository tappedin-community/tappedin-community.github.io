Iteration 3 by Matt

<p>
A before/after of the chat client w/tab as we talked about in yesterday's meeting (drag them both in a browser, then toggle back and forth between the two images to get a sense of how it may feel), a quick visual demo of what a pop-up window may look like (if we were to do "sharing management" via a pop up window, rather than targeting it into the "Attention" frame), and an anatomy of the "Who" palette....Anatomies of Search and My palettes are coming, as are more variations on how to make the "Attention" frame (second frame, if counting from the top left clockwise) more interesting. </p>
