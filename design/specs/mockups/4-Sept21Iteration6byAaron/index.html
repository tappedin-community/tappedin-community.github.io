Iteration 6 by Aaron
<!--#include virtual="/archive/ti2design/includes/endtitle.inc"-->


<p>Attempts to address what was brought up at our meeting yesterday; doesn't completely tackle the extreme specifics of location-navigation (there are still some wholes and incongruities). It at least gives us a visual representation of the problems at hand. The first image shows your view as you enter a space with the chat activated. The second image shows chat collapsed and a "content" tab selected that sits over top of the "current room."</p> 

<p>Aaron also provides a sample login screen and layout at http://www.storybreathing.com/tappedin/UI/ and a couple approaches to incorporate geography into TI2 without literal maps: http://www.storybreathing.com/tappedin/autumnblue</p>
