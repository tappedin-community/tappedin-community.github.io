Iteration 7 by Aaron
<!--#include virtual="/archive/ti2design/includes/endtitle.inc"-->

<p>Addresses many design questions that arose in a meeting on 9/26 regarding screen organization. The more design decisions we make, the more questions arrise, but we do seem to be getting somewhere. I like the instances where an icon-language gets built up (like for IM on these examples) and think it would be good to move more in that direction overall because for now, there are too many navigation options that are text-only</p>
