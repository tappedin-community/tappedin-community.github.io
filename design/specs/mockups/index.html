<h2>TI2 Mockups</h2>

We are developing a series of user interface mockups for TI2 that take 
into account our experience with TAPPED IN,  
<a href="../scenarios">user scenarios</a> submitted by team members, 
and our NSF proposal.
The mockups have been created in collaboration with our interaction 
designers Matt Manley and Aaron Becker.

<h3>History</h3>

<p>A history of the TI2 interface evolution, in mockups, from Aug 2001-January 2002. 
Implementation began in the late spring of 2002.</p>

 The one change I did not make was finding a way to have content flexible 
 in terms of width/expansion when moderator's choose to hide or add extra content.  
 This topic is a little involved for now, and I think we're going to have to 
 decide what actually is editable and what is set in stone before trying to 
 tackle that kind of formatting issue.

<a href="6-Oct18Iteration8byAaron/index.html">Oct 18 Iteration 8 by Aaron</a>. Aaron asked about 
content to go in the room area. We probably need some kind
of layout template that includes things like a room drawing (customizable),
a text description (customizable), a customizable (optional) URL that the owner wants to make prominent (e.g., their home page, a tenants home page), 
a folder/cabinet that links to the owner/groups public documents (any
files they upload, and urls they make public, etc.)
I think we decided that what appears in the room map should be the same for
both the owner and visitor, so as not to confuse people and be consistent.
E.g., if I'm in my office and you come join me and I refer to something in
my space that you don't see, that would be confusing. Anything I want to
make accessible to you, I need to make public (then it will appear in my
public document folder in my room, or in a search on me).
<br><br>
<a href="5-Oct1Iteration7byAaron/index.html">Oct 1 Iteration 7 by Aaron</a>. Addresses many design
questions that arose in a meeting on 9/26 regarding screen organization.
The more design decisions we make, the more questions arrise, but we do 
seem to be 
getting somewhere.  The one comment overall on these from Aaron is 
that he likes the instances where an icon-language gets built up 
(like for IM on these examples) and thinks it would be good to move more 
in that direction overall because for now, there are too many 
navigation options that are text-only.
<br><br>

<a href="4-Sept21Iteration6byAaron/index.html">Sept 21 Iteration 6 by Aaron</a>.
Attempts to address what was brought up at our meeting yesterday;
doesn't completely tackle the extreme specifics of location-navigation
(there are still some wholes and incongruities).  It at 
least gives us a visual representation of the problems at hand.  The 
first image shows your view as you enter a space with the chat 
activated.  The second image shows chat collapsed and a "content" tab 
selected that sits over top of the "current room". 
<br><br>
<a href="http://www.storybreathing.com/tappedin/autumnblue">Sept 17 Iteration 5 by Aaron</a>.
A couple approaches by Aarron to incorporating geography into TI2 without literal maps.
<br><br>
<a href="http://www.storybreathing.com/tappedin/UI">Sept 7 Iteration 4 by Aaron</a>. Aaron's first stab at deciphering
the <a href="../documents/Funcspec2.doc">functional design draft (8/23)</a> created by Melissa, which summarizes the major features proposed for the
system.
<br><br>
<a href="3-Aug24Iteration3byMatt/index.html">Aug 24 Iteration 3 by Matt</a>. A before/after of the chat 
client w/tab as we talked about in yesterday's meeting 
(drag them both in a browser, then
toggle back and forth between the two images to get a sense of how it may
feel), a quick visual demo of what a pop-up window may look like (if we were
to do "sharing management" via a pop up window, rather than targeting it
into the "Attention" frame), and an anatomy of the "Who"
palette....Anatomies of Search and My palettes are coming, as are more
variations on how to make the "Attention" frame (second frame, if counting
from the top left clockwise) more interesting.
<br><br>
<a href="2-Aug23Iteration2byMatt/index.html">Aug 23 Iteration 2 by Matt</a>. Matt's next pass at sketches. 
We focused on 3 issues in our meeting: how to indicate to the user that 
they can get info or chat or IM someone,  more options for search, and 
show how file upload would happen.
People info: one option would be to put tiny icons by people's names 
in the WHO list, one for info, one for chat, one for IM (microphone?). 
Need to watch out for icon proliferation though. Gray out icons if the 
person isn't in chat or doesn't want others to IM them. For search, we 
talked about checkboxes that the user could select from to search over 
files, individuals, groups, courses, urls, status (online or offline 
right now), mentors. For files, we talked about looking at how Yahoo does 
file upload and how it displays filenames. We don't want to require 
javascript or java; simple text is fine.
<br><br>
<a href="1-Aug22InitialSketchesbyMatt/index.html">Aug 22, 2001 Initial Sketches by Matt</a>. 
The TAPPED IN team met 
and discussed this first pass with Matt today. We decided to (a) not 
assume that the chat frame is always visible, (b) make the default 
info you see when you log in be announcements about what is new (new 
messages, files, course notes, etc. for you) on the right, and your 
navigation bar (left) and (c) make the room graphic fade (either light 
background, or small icon, or some kind of frame around content; not sure). 
Matt is incorporating our comments and will have another set of sketches soon.
