<h2>Administration Specification</h2>
<p>Tenant admins only have appropriate powers over rooms in their own tenant building 
  (entering locked rooms, editing rooms and items in<br>
  rooms etc.) and users/groups in their tenant [1]. TI Admins have all powers 
  in all rooms[1]. Many of these actions should allow the administrator to optionally 
  email the affected users to notify them of the change (the email would be automatially 
  generated) [2]<br>

<ul>
  <li>change username[1]</li>

<p>Notes from Judi, which should all be reflected above</p>
<p>Audience TAPPED IN staff and partner organization staff. TAPPED IN staff will 
  have more abilities than org staff and will be able to see data on ALL members. 
  Org staff will just be able to perform administrative tasks on people in their 
  organization.<br>
  Account Management:<br>
</p>
<ul>
  <li>Create Batch accounts (from a tab delimited file if an organization wants 
    to do so). Assign one password to all accounts made in a batch or for a group 
    (useful for a training). <br>
  </li>
  <li>Reset passwords. Org admin should be able to reset passwords of people in 
    their organization. There should be a way to randomly generate a password 
    or reset it to the password the person requests. (The ability to reset it 
    to the password a person requests may not be as necessary in the new system 
    as it was in the old command line system. Members had difficulty changing 
    their password. It would be nice if we could email reminders of current passwords. 
  </li>
  <li>Delete accounts (TI staff only). When accounts are deleted there should 
    be two modes, immediate deletion and deletion after a warning. Immediate deletion 
    occurs as soon as the TI staff member hits the button and an email notice 
    is sent to the member (now ex- member) notifying them that their account has 
    been terminated. The second mode, deletion after a warning, is designed so 
    that our database isn&#146;t filled up with inactive members who are too lazy 
    to ask to be deleted. TI staff specify a length of time, and if a member has 
    not logged in for that duration (e.g., 6 months) they are sent an email telling 
    them their account will be deleted in X days if they do not log in (or reply 
    to the message if possible). In this warning email, the member will be sent 
    a reminder of his / her username and password and perhaps an announcement 
    from a group or about a session that corresponds to his/her interests as designated 
    on the registration form. </li>
  <li>De-affiliate members from a group (for example, Pepperdine&#146;s graduates 
    may still want to be a member of TAPPED IN, but Pepperdine may not want them 
    affiliated with them any more since they aren&#146;t students. Admin&#146;s 
    for orgs should be able to change members no longer affiliated with their 
    organization to a regular member. This de-affiliation ability may be important 
    if a future business model is going to charge a subscription fee to members. 
    For TI staff admin&#146;s they should be able to change a member&#146;s organization 
    affiliation. For example, people may have joined on their own and then their 
    organization starts working with TI. We should be able to have a way to change 
    their affiliation to that new org. Also, it should add a new affiliation automatically 
    if an organization submits a batch membership list and has someone on the 
    list who already has a TI account.&#133; Note, this assumes that there is 
    a way a member can be able to be affiliated with two orgs simultaneously. 
    For example, we had a lot of members in LACOE who are also affiliated with 
    Pepperdine. It may be the case that an organization pays to have an &#147;upgrade&#148; 
    to membership for their members e.g., more storage space. If that&#146;s the 
    case, the Pepperdine member should get that upgrade and if LACOE does that 
    too then the member should get two upgrades&#133; right? 
    <ul>
      <li>Question, is two organizations enough to have a member affiliated with? 
        How many do we think one person may be associated with at any one time? 
        <br>
      </li>
      <li>There are also questions about what happens to a person&#146;s stuff 
        in a group room if they are de-affiliated? Do we assume since they uploaded 
        the files/links to the room that they stay affiliated with the room even 
        though they may no longer have access to the room? <br>
      </li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>Change User names other personal info (email addresses etc., the user should 
    be able to update all of his/her info as well in settings, but it&#146;s good 
    for an admin to be able to do it too).<br>
  </li>
  <li>Set/reset default of amount of space for members file storage either by 
    individual member or by group. (TI staff only)<br>
  </li>
  <li>Set level of permissions on the user when you create accounts (TI-Admin 
    can set any level, Org-admin can set sub-admins for their org) Levels include 
    Course instructor, regular member, Org-Admin, TI-Admin, K-12 student, potentially 
    parent?? For courses we need to determine how we are going to do this since 
    courses involve payment.</li>
