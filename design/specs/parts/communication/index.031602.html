<h2>Communication Tools</h2>
</b>
<p><small><i>Priorities for features indicated in brackets []. Priorities are 
  marked with a 1 (must have by Sept 2002); 2 (should have by December 2002); 
  or a 3 (may have my June 2003). If a feature is marked but its subfeatures are 
  not, this means that the subfeatures have the same priority as the larger feature.</i></small> 
</p>
<p><b><br>
  </b>Communication tools will be integrated throughout the TI2 environment to 
  support all of the other features (i.e. courses, groups, etc.). Users must be 
  able to work together synchronously as well as asynchronously. Some of the tools 
  are room- or place-based meaning that the message is only seen in a certain 
  location while other tools are user-based meaning the message goes either to 
  the user's personal email account or a window appears where ever they are in 
  Tapped In as is the case with Private Message.<br>
  <br>
  Communication tools will include: </p>

<h2><b>Synchronous Communication</b> </h2>
</font> 
<p><font face="Times"><b> Chat [1]</b></font></p>
<p><font face="Times"> A chat window will appear on every room (see figure below). 
  The chat window includes</font></p>
  <p>
<ul>
  <li>Input areas for entering chat and PM text <b>[1]</b> 
  <li> Ouput areas for displaying chat and received PM messages<b> [1]</b> 
  <li>Awareness tabs showingusernames for who is in the room, who is online, and 
    who and where your buddies are <b>[1]</b> 
  <li>A font preferences menu that lets theuser change the font size<b> [1]</b> 
    or color <b>[2]</b>. 
  <li>Actions menu that allows the user to 
    <ul>
      <li>set their mood/status<b> [2] </b>to some text value like &quot;busy&quot;, 
        which appears by their name when they talk or PM</li>
      <li>become temporarily unavailable<b> [2] </b>where they can't see or send 
        chat or pm messages but can still move around and see who is online and 
        others can see them</li>
      <li>project urls <b>[1] </b>to others in the room. the url will pop up in 
        a new window. subsequent projections will replace same one window</li>
      <li>jot notes onto a scratch pad <b>[1]</b> to compose longer thoughts to 
        paste into chat, or paste in chat text they want to save and read slowly</li>
      <li> share a whiteboard<b> [3] </b>way in the future, to be spec'd out later</li>
      <li>detach the chat window to make it bigger<b> [2] </b>and the detached 
        window will have a reattach menu option</li>
    </ul>
</ul>
<p>The format of messages in the output window is not set, but will be of one 
  of the following forms:</p>
<blockquote> 
  <p>Mark: has your class started?<br>
    Mark says, &quot;has your class started?&quot;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The MOO substituted pronouns, so that text you wrote appeared to you as &quot;You 
  say,....&quot; while appearing to others as &quot;Mark says,..&quot;. This feature 
  could be provided as an option or user preference<b> [2]</b>. The first version 
  can show the same text to all users, including the speaker (i.e., Mark will 
  see &quot;Mark says....&quot; in the output field, the same as what others see).</p>
<font face="Times">
<p><img src="chatopen.gif" width="695" height="207"></p>
</font> 
<p><font face="Times">Dimensions of the various areas should be similar to that 
  shown above, but may vary when implemented. For example, the Here/Online/Buddies 
  area is about 200 pixels wide above, and the rest of the width of the page goes 
  to the chat area. The input fields should fill the space up to the Say and PM 
  buttons, unlike in the image above. The input areas for chat and pm will be 
  one line each. If we allow resizing, the chat output area will be the area to 
  grow or shrink.</font></p>
<p>200 pixels wide, and the rest of the width of the page goes to the chat area. 
  He has the chat menu area (Actions, Fonts) as about 35 pixels high, and the 
  input fields (chat and pm together) area as about 70 pixels high. See</p>
<p><font face="Times">The chat should handle at least 500 simultaneous logins 
  with up to 50 people in one room, or 500 simultaneous users in one room listening 
  to one speaker. <b>[1]</b> Support for up to 1000 simultaneous users is desired<b> 
  [3]</b>. Some rooms may also restrict the number of speakers or enforce moderated 
  discusson <b>[2]</b>.</font></p>
<p><font face="Times">Chat transcripts should be saved and emailed to users upon 
  logout.</font> </p>
<p>Note: Chat settings and preferences (like font size, tab placement, mood/status, 
  etc.) are NOT saved across sessions.</p>
<ul>
  <ul>
  </ul>
</ul>
<p><b>Private Message [1]</b></p>
<p>To send a PM, a user clicks on the face icon beside a username in the Here, 
  Online, or Buddies list. The username then appears beside the PM text field 
  at the bottom. The user can then enter text into the PM field and click the 
  PM button to send the text to the other user.</p>
<p>Private messages will be visually distinguished from other chat messages in 
  the output area. They may have a prefix like &quot;(*PM)&quot;,<b>[1]</b> or 
  they may be displayed in bold text [2]. E.g.,, If I'm Joe and Mark sends me 
  a PM, I will see</p>
<blockquote>
  <p>(*PM) Mark says, &quot;Can we talk after the meeting?&quot;</p>
</blockquote>
<p> and Mark will see</p>
<blockquote>
  <p>(PM to Joe) Mark says, &quot;Can we talk after the meeting?&quot;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>If a user sends a PM to another user who is not logged in or logged in and 
  not available, that message is saved in the other user's Saved Messages. The 
  sender will then see an additional line like:</p>
<blockquote> 
  <p> (PM to Joe is saved, Joe is unavailable: It's proposal crunch time. I will 
    try and get back to everyone ASAP...)</p>
</blockquote>
<p>We could make the name of a person in the output area clickable for fast PM 
  replies, but this may be technically difficult<b> [3]</b>.</p>
<p><b>Emote [2]</b></p>
<p>As we do now in TAPPED IN, if a user types a special character (like a &quot;:&quot;) 
  before what they type in an imput field, it will be displayed as an emote. For 
  example, if I type the following into either the SAY or PM input field</p>
<blockquote>
  <p>I'm happy</p>
</blockquote>
<p>and press Say or PM, the recipient(s) would see one of</p>
<blockquote>
  <p>Patti: I'm happy<br>
    Patti says, &quot;I'm happy&quot;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>But if I type</p>
<blockquote>
  <p>:smiles</p>
</blockquote>
<p>they would see</p>
<blockquote> 
  <p>Patti smiles</p>
</blockquote>
<p>We could also consider adding an Emote... item to the Actions menu <b>[3]</b> 
  E.g., we could prepopulate a 2nd level menu with emote text, like smiles, laughs, 
  waves, and allow a Custom Message to be set. Selecting an emote item could put 
  it in the chat input area. </p>
<p><b>Broadcast [2]</b></p>
<p>We may need to support broadcast messages by TAPPED IN staff to all users. 
  Like emotes, we could do this with a special keyboard character or command, 
  especially since it will only be available to a few, select (staff) members. 
  Broadcast messages may appear on the bottom left status area of the window (see 
  Status Area below).</p>
<p><b>Font Prefs [1]</b></p>
<p><font face="Times">If a user changes the font size in the Font prefs menu, 
  then the font size of the 2 input areas and 1 output area will change to this 
  size [1]. No other fonts (the menus, the lists, etc.) will change. </font></p>
<p><font face="Times">If a user chooses a color from the Font prefs menu, then 
  all of her messages will appear in this color (to herself and to others) in 
  the output window. </font></p>
<p><font face="Times"></font>TBD: Font menu may be moved to the Actions menu. 
  If so, it may be split out into to items: Set My Font Color and Set Font Size.</p>
<p><b>Set Status [1]</b></p>
<p>Users can indicate their &quot;moods&quot; or &quot;status&quot; via the Actions/Set 
  Status button. These are just tags (like happy, busy, cooking) and these do 
  not do<br>
  anything except appear by their name when they talk or when you PM them.</p>
<p> For example, if Mark selects Actions/Set Status/busy, any text he types will 
  appear in chat or PM with at [busy] flag, as so: </p>
<blockquote> 
  <p>Mark [busy]: has your class started?</p>
</blockquote>
<p>A set of predetermined status options will appear in the 2nd tier menu (or 
  as a popup window if tiered menus are not technically possible). These preset 
  options include: busy, out to lunch, be right back, stepped out. </p>
<p>A final menu option called &quot;custom message&quot; [2] will appear below 
  these preset options, and pop up a text dialog if selected. In this dialog the 
  user can type custom status text and it will be set.</p>
<p><b>Become Unavailable [2]</b></p>
<p>Folks who really want to be completely unavailable can use the &quot;Become 
  Unavailable&quot; option under the Action menu. When you are in unavailable 
  mode, others can see that you are online and where you are, but they cannot 
  talk to you in real time. You can see who all the information in the awareness 
  tabs (who is online, here, your buddies) and can move around to different rooms, 
  but you cannot chat or PM to people. Basically, unavailable mode means you have 
  awareness and movement, but no communication.</p>
<p>If you choose Become Unavailable, then your chat area gets covered with a message 
  saying that others can't contact you now, a text field appears where you can 
  edit your unavailable message (what others see if they try to PM you), and a 
  &quot;Become Available&quot; button appears that you can click to return to 
  chat or PM.</p>
<p>In the Here/Online/Buddies tabls, unavailable users appear in grey font, while 
  available users are in black font.</p>
<p> If you get a PM while you're unavailable, you will be notified in this area 
  in red text that your new PMs are in your saved messages. The person who PM'd 
  you will get your unavailable message.</p>
<p>Contents of the chat window while you are in unavailable mode will not be recorded 
  to your transcript. You only get to see what you hear and what others expect 
  you to hear. If you are unavailable then others may want to say things assuming 
  you can't hear them. If you can get a transcript of what they said, it may violate 
  their privacy. If you want to hear a discussion, you must be available.</p>
<p><img src="chatunavailable.gif" width="725" height="235"></p>
<p><font face="Times"><b>Project URL [1]</b></font></p>
<p><font face="Times">To project a url to other users in the same room or to an 
  individual, the user types a url into the Say field (to project ot the room) 
  or the PM field (to project to an individual) and then selects Project Url from 
  the Actions menu. The url will then open in a new window on the screen of the 
  recipient(s) (everyone in the room, or the individual).</font></p>
<p><font face="Times">If the user just presses the Say or PM button and a URL 
  is in the input field, it will be treated as normal text, although future versions 
  may make the url text into a link so that users can click on it at will to pop 
  up a new window with the URL [3].</font></p>
<p><b>Scratch Pad [2]</b></p>
<p>When a user selects Scratch Pad from the Actions menu, a new window appears 
  with a text area in which they can compose longer message. The scratch pad will 
  have a &quot;Send to Chat&quot; enables the user to send the text to the Chat, 
  or they can copy and paste the text into the chat or PM field when they are 
  ready. There is no save feature on the scratch pad; once the window is closed, 
  the text is gone.</p>
<p>We coujld also add a Don't Auto Scroll Output option to the Action menu to 
  let the user turn off output field scrolling temporarily.</p>
<p><b>Detach [2]</b></p>
<p>When a user selects Action/Detach, a new window appears (as in the current 
  TAPestry client) that they can resize and make bigger for typing and viewing 
  conversations. Similar to the attached chat window, it will include an output 
  field, and chat and PM input field and buttons. It will also include the same 
  Action and Font menu, except the Action menu will have a &quot;Reattach&quot; 
  option instead of a Detach option. By default, the input area will be 3 lines, 
  and the output area will increase or shrink on resize.</p>
<p><font face="Times" color="#000000"><b>Here, Online, Buddies[1]</b></font></p>
<p>The Here, Online, and Buddies tabs show alphabetical lists of usernames. The 
  people are listed by login/username, not real name, so each entry is unique. 
  In some cases the location of the user is shown. Up to X (10?) characters of 
  the user's location will be displayed.</p>
<p> Here is an alphabetical list of all people in the room that you are in. Online 
  is an alphabetical list of all people who are logged in to TAPPED IN, and where 
  they are right now. Buddies is an alphabetical list of people who you have bookmarked 
  as your favorites in TI. All of your buddies show up in the Buddies tab, whether 
  they are online or not. If they are online, their location is shown; if they 
  are offline, the location appears as &quot;Offline&quot;.</p>
<p>In the here, online, and buddies list, names are underlined and clicking on 
  them will show more information about that user.<b> [2]</b> The information 
  may replace the room view, as it would if you clicked on a user under the People 
  tab. If this is technically do from the chat applet, we will drop it and only 
  allow clicking on a user name from the HTML area (e.g., under People) in the 
  first release.</p>
<p>A &quot;face&quot; icon appears beside peoples names in all tabs. Clicking 
  on the face icon puts their name in the PM area so you can PM them. <b>[1]</b></p>
<p>An &quot;activity&quot; icon may also appear beside names <b>[2].</b> This 
  icon is a circle in some shade of blue. Dark blue indicates active (they have 
  typed recently). The color fades one shade for every ten minutes that the user 
  hasn't typed. If the user hasn't typed in 100 minutes or longer, the circle 
  is white. Unavailable users are treated the same as available users. If Mark 
  is talking actively and then goes unavailable, his username goes gray immediately 
  but the circle beside his name is still dark blue. Ten minutes later it goes 
  a shade lighter, etc. Buddies who are offline do not have a circle icon beside 
  their name.</p>
<p>When a user clicks a tab on the client, the server is notified of which tab 
  is showing, and keeps track. When the Here tab is showing, the server sends 
  continual update only for changes in information for that particular room.. 
  When a user clicks the Online or Buddies tabs, the client does a &quot;pull&quot; 
  to get a snapshot of who is online, and perhaps displays a timestamp of the 
  snapshot on the tab info. The Online and Buddies tabs do not update continuously. 
  If the user click on the Online or Buddies tab again, it does another pull. 
  In a later release, we may add a &quot;continually update&quot; option for tabs.<b>[3]</b></p>
<p>Note that if we become wildly popular and the Online tab has thousands of users 
  in it, it may become useless. We may drop it at that point, and only offer Search 
  in the upper html area (above chat, not part of the chat client).<br>
</p>
<p>Users can edit their Buddies list from their Me/People tab <b>[1]</b>. They 
  may also be able to edit it from the Buddies tab <b>[2]</b></p>
<p>In the edit buddies area, the user sees a list of their buddies with a remove 
  link beside each name, like so:</p>
<table width="80%" border="0" cellspacing="5" cellpadding="5" align="center">
  <tr> 
    <td><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Judy Smith</font></td>

  This may be part of the chat applet, or part of the HTML frame. For faster update, 
  we may want to make it part of the chat applet.</p>

<p><font face="Times">The whiteboard won't be designed and implemented under our

<h2><b>Asynchronous Communication</b></h2>
<p><b>Saved Messages [1]</b></p>
<p>Saved Messages appear under the users Me tab. The entire contents of the saved 
  message is displayed, and can be deleted by the recipient whenever desired.</p>
<p>Users are notified of Saved Messages in several ways, including red text in 
  the status area at the bottom right that says <font face="Times" color="#ff0000">You 
  have X saved messages, <font color="#000000">as well as a flag icon on the Me
