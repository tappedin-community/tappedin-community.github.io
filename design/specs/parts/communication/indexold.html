<h3><i>1.0 Description of Communication Tools in Prometheus:</i></h3>
</B> 
<UL>
  <LI><i>Threaded Discussion and Bulletin Board. The discussion section of Prometheus 
    allows class members to conduct an asynchronous threaded discussion by posting 
    comments to a discussion board under a particular topic. Instructors can categorize 
    the discussions, delete topics, and administer the threaded discussion. Each 
    workgroup or team can have its own section of the discussion board, accessible 
    only to members in that group. </i></LI>
</UL>
<UL>
  <LI><i>Messages and Announcements. Instructors can send messages to a class 
    as well as post general announcements. Announcements appear at the top of 
    the first page students see upon logging in. Instructors also have the choice 
    of sending individual, group, or broadcast email messages to the class. </i></LI>
</UL>
<UL>
  <LI><i>Chat. Prometheus supports text chat as well as voice chat. Text chat 
    allows any student in a course to communicate real-time with any other student 
    in the course. Students and groups in the course can create their own private, 
    password-protected chat rooms. Chats can also be logged so transcripts can 
    be viewed at a later time. Prometheus currently supports one-way voice chat 
    in the chat rooms. Two-way voice chat is planned for the upcoming Prometheus 
    release. The latest version of Macromedia's free Shockwave plug-in must be 
    downloaded for the user to access the chat room. </i></LI>
</UL>
<UL>
  <LI><i>Whiteboard. The synchronous whiteboard feature allows instructors and 
    students to create diagrams and illustrations in the chat room using the mouse. 
    The drawing tool's color and diameter can be modified, and a text tool can 
    be used on the whiteboard as well. Slide shows can be created and pushed through 
    the whiteboard. This allows the user all whiteboard writing and drawing features 
    on top of the slides. </i></LI>
</UL>
<UL>
  <LI><i>Notepad. Each user also has a notepad for jotting down notes as he or 
    she progresses through the course. Only that individual has access to these 
    personal notes. Notes are searchable through the main search function, and 
    the note taker does not have to leave the learning environment to use the 
    notepad feature. </i> </LI>
</UL>

<FONT FACE="Times"> </FONT> 
<h3><i>1.1 Questions for Prometheus:</i></h3>
<OL>
  <LI>Can chats and whiteboards be associated with other features besides courses, 
    for example groups and an individual&#146;s portal?</LI>
  <P>Yes.</P>
  <LI>Can we use our own chat and IM instead?</LI>
  <P>Yes.</P>
  <LI>Is the Shockwave tool used for the chat feature part of the source code 
    that we can modify?</LI>
</OL>


<P>No. The chat feature is supplied by a 3<SUP>rd</SUP> party. Prometheus is looking at other chat providers.</P>

<P>&nbsp;</P>
<P><i><b><font size="+1">2.0 Communication Tools by Type</font></b></i></P>
<P>The communication tools will be integrated throughout the TI environment to 
  support all of the other features (i.e. courses, groups, etc.). Users must be 
  able to work together synchronously as well as asynchronously. Some of the tools 
  are room- or place-based meaning that the message is only seen in a certain 
  location while other tools are person-based meaning the message goes either 
  to the person&#146;s personal email account or a window appears where ever they 
  are in Tapped In as is the case with Private Message. Communication tools will 
  include: </P>

<P>The current Tapped In 1.0 and Prometheus have many of these features already 
  developed. Considerable work will need to be done to determine how best to build 
  these tools given the existing tools in Prometheus and Tapped In 1.0. (Existing 
  tools in TI1.0 are marked by an *. Tools that Prometheus has in its system are 
  marked (Prometheus).)</P>
