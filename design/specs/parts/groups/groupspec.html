<h3><i>1.0 Scenario</i></h3>
</B><FONT FACE="Times"> 
<UL>
  <LI>Renee uses the chat and whiteboard in her Math Modeling for Elementary Group. 
    On the whiteboard, she draws graphical as well as numeric models. Other group 
    members use the chat and write on the whiteboard to comment on her thoughts.</LI>
  <LI>Sometimes during the Math Modeling group meetings, she (Michael&#146;s scenario) 
    does a quick search of her own resources and projects a relevant posting or 
    web site to the group for discussion. Renee takes a few moments to walk the 
    group through the web site that she has found useful. Sally, a member of the 
    group, likes the resource so she files it in her office quickly for later 
    reference.</LI>
  <LI>Later, Renee (RoryC&#146;s scenario) browses the public groups to see if 
    there are others of interest. There&#146;s a group hanging out in the BookMark, 
    a book club discussion spot, and a smaller group in the woods, doing Lord 
    knows what. She doesn&#146;t recognize any names in either group; besides 
    she&#146;s not in the mood for chat. She checks out the policy discussion 
    board and finds herself sucked in to a threaded discussion on &#145;high stakes 
    testing.&#146; There are even postings by Carlos there! She notices remarks 
    about the Rouge Forum and opens up a brief description of the group with a 
    link to their TI offices. She pops over and noses around in the resources 
    there. She decides it looks interesting and sets her membership profile to 
    accept messages/announcements from them. Almost immediately she gets a note 
    announcing the upcoming Special Guest session with Susan Ohanian that will 
    be held in the TI Civic Auditorium next week. She forwards the note to her 
    TI calendar, which she has set to send her email reminders on a weekly basis.</LI>
  <LI>In her online course, Renee (Elaine&#146;s scenario) participates in small 
    group collaborations. At the end of the course, each group presents their 
    projects in the student presentation area. To collaborate, Renee&#146;s group 
    uses the special discussion area that her instructor has set up for them, 
    but they find they brainstorm and plan best in the live chat area, which is 
    always available. They also use the built-in email function to communicate 
    and share. One person in their group, Reggie, offers to create a Web page 
    using the built-in home page templates for their final project presentation, 
    and they are able to view and revise it together in the chat room as they 
    develop the project. They learn that other groups are creating their projects 
    in PowerPoint and Adobe Acrobat, as well as Web pages. All these projects 
    will be shared during the final two weeks of the course. During that time, 
    they will review all their peers' projects in the student presentation area 
    and give them feedback using the rubric developed by their instructor. The 
    final projects will be added to the STELLAR community library database so 
    that they will continue to be accessible to everyone after the course is completed.</LI>
  <LI>Renee first joined TI through the STELLAR community. Joyce is the administrator 
    for the STELLAR community; she set up the STELLAR group that consists of 10 
    public groups; 7 private groups; and 8 courses. Members of the STELLAR group 
    can set up additional sub groups and courses at any time. Everyone who comes 
    to TI, members and guests, can find STELLAR in the public groups and learn 
    more by clicking on the link to the STELLAR main page. The main page lists 
    all the public groups; members of the private groups and courses would also 
    see their respective private groups and courses listed here.</LI>

<P><b>2.0 Description from Prometheus</b>:<FONT FACE="Times"> </FONT>Instructors 
  as well as students, if authorized by the administrator, can create groups as 
  part of a course or completely separate from any course offered. All group events 
  are integrated into a user's calendar, and all discussions are reflected in 
  the user's discussion section of Prometheus. Each group has its own private 
  area to schedule events, post announcements to the group, conduct discussions 
  or chats, and share files. Instructors also have the choice of sending individual, 
  group, or broadcast email messages to a class.</P>
<P>An affinity group can be public, private, or hidden and can have multiple owners:</P>
<P>* Public groups can set default membership for all students, all faculty and 
  staff, or all users.<br>
  * Private groups require a password to gain access.<br>
  * Hidden group membership is controlled by group owners.</P>
<P>A user with administrative access (Admin Level or Group Admin Level) to Prometheus 
  can change passwords for individuals in the groups the user is authorized to 
  administer. He or she also has the ability to "skin" the user interface for 
  all users associated with this group.</P>

<UL>
  <UL>
    <LI>Can someone set up a group that is not associated with a course and is 
      on a different topic than any course offered? (see Initiators of Groups)</LI>

  <UL>
    <LI>Can an individual member (regardless of instructor or student status) 
      set up a group?</LI>
  </UL>
</UL>
<DIR> <I> 
  <P>We will need to change the Prometheus code to allow all users the ability 
    to set up groups. Currently, in Prometheus only administrator can create groups. 
    We want all members to be able to set up groups. Each member can set up two 
    groups.</P>
  </I></DIR>
<UL>
  <UL>
    <LI>Can public groups still require admin approval for new members?</LI>
  </UL>
</UL>
<I> 
<P>Prometheus doesn&#146;t have this function for public groups. There is no approval. 
  You can join if it is public. We may want to notify the group intitator of new 
  members. New members should receive a welcome email.</P>
</I> 
<UL>
  <UL>
    <LI>Why are private groups displayed to people who can&#146;t access them? 
      Private groups could be &quot;hidden&quot; in that they only appear to members 
      and invited members. </LI>
  </UL>
</UL>
<I> 
<P>This is a UI problem with Prometheus. You should not be able to click on a 
  group and get a &quot;Go Away&quot; message. Only public groups should be listed. 
  Private groups are invite only.</P>
</I> 
<UL>
  <UL>
    <LI>What are the benefits of having hidden vs. private groups as described 
      by Prometheus?</LI>
  </UL>
</UL>
<I> 
<P>Hidden groups are for projects or meetings that require a set number of members 
  or a not to exceed this number of members. It is private in the sense that you 
  have to be invited. Not sure whether or not it requires a password, but some 
  URL would be sent if not username and password. At this time, we are not interested 
  in using the hidden feature.</P>

<P>The initiator of a group can change the private and public status of a group<SUP><b>3</b></SUP>. 
  However, there are many issues that may make this a technical and social nightmare, 
  such as how are members of a public group made private group members easily. 
  In version 2.0, it may be cleaner to have initiator create a new group if they 
  needed to change from public to private or visa versa. In cases of emergency, 
  a TI Administrator can change the status.<b>1</b></P>

<P>&nbsp;</P>
<B>
<P>5.2 Tenants </P>
</B><P>Tenant groups are made up of subgroups. The subgroups function the same as the public and private groups described above. (Note: Check to see how (or if) Prometheus will work with the concept of subgroups. Discuss best options once this is understood from the software.) The large, main tenant group that encompasses the subgroups has additional functionality that the tenant has paid for:</P>

<UL>
<LI>Additional admin capabilities and admin control</LI>
<LI>Ability to add sub groups</LI>
<LI>Can create more than the standard individual allowance (2 groups and more than one message boards) per group. </LI>
<LI>Pay for additional groups and message boards. Standard package is  XX.</LI>
<LI>Tenant members see their specific tenant materials in the navigation bar with the Me and Community tabs.</LI></UL>


<P>The main tenant large group functions like a public moderated group. It can also be completely private if the tenant requests that functionality.</P>

<UL>
<LI>Classes and public groups are listed on the Tenant&#146;s Group Page, viewable by members of the Tenant Group.</LI></UL>


<UL>
<LI>Tenants have a public page viewable by all TI members. (Unless the Tenant pays extra to be completely private.) Tenants can customize this page further for the public.</LI>
<LI>Tenant members become tenant members in two ways</LI>

<UL>
<LI>the same as all private groups; initiators (in this case the Tenant administrator) sends an invitation through the system to the potential member. This invitation contains the Group ID and password.</LI>
<LI>A list of TI member and non TI members can be entered. When a member logs in or a new member signs up and logs in for the first time, they are automatically part of the tenant. They see the tenant listed under Me and it appears as a tab in their navigation.</LI></UL>

<LI>Members of tenant groups who want to form a group within the tenant organization must ask the administrator of the larger tenant group to set up their group &#151; public or private. These members are then given administrative privileges to administer that group.</LI>
<LI>Requests by members are sent via email through the system; on the main Tenant&#146;s Group Page, there is an email link to the Tenant administrator and TI staff.</LI></UL>

<h3><i>6.0 Gaining membership to Groups </i></h3>
<P><b>6.1 Invitations 1</b></P>
<P>In both private and public groups, members of a group can send an <a href="Invitation.html">invitation</a> 
  from the group inviting a TAPPED IN member or nonmember to join the group. The 
  member sending the email must know the person&#146;s member name or email address. 
  Automatically included in the email is the URL for the group; and if it is a 
  private group, the ID and password. The sender can include a text message as 
  well. Since they are invited, a moderator does not need to approve their membership. 
  <B></B></P>
<B>
<P>6.2 Open signup 1 </P>
</B>
<P>Members of the community can sign up for the group at any time without a moderator&#146;s approval</P>

<B>
<P>6.3 Moderator approved 1</P>
</B><P>Members of the community can sign up for the group at any time, but need a moderator&#146;s approval to become a member. If the member has been invited by a moderator or the initator, there is no need for approval. Other group members can invite, but moderator approval needed for them to join.</P>

<P>The flow of moderator approval is as follows:</P>
<P><a href="Jointhisgroup.html"><font face="Times"> <a href="Jointhisgroup.html">User 
  logs in with their username</a></font>, requesting to join this group.</a></P>
<P>Moderator is notified via email and in their office when they log in there 
  is an announcement. The announcement is clickable.</P>
<P>The announcement links to <a href="ApproveMembershipreq.html">Member Approval 
  page</a></P>
<P>On Member Approval page, the administrator sees:</P>

<P>Member&#146;s name</P>
<P>Link to Identity page</P>
<P>Any comments/reasons for joining that the member may have sent</P>

<P>The Moderator then chooses Approve or Reject. The <a href="Approvemessage.html">Approval 
  Message page</a> confirms the selection and offers the opportunity to customize 
  a message to the user:</P>
<P>+ Approve (Welcome message is generated)</P>

<P>+ Reject (Some reason for rejecting members must be written)</P>

<P><B>Note: Judi/Patti: Administrate function should include more details on moderator 
  approval.<br>
