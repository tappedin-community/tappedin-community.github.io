<p><b>Guest and Demo accounts</b></p>
<p><b>Demo accounts [1]</b></p>
<p>Five demo accounts will be created with names of the Marx Brothers: ChicoM, 
  HarpoM, GrouchoM, GummoM, and ZeppoM. [1]</p>
<p>These accounts are like regular member accounts and have access to everything 
  that any general tappedin member has access to, like the ability to create an 
  office, add buddies, etc. [1]</p>
<p>Demo accounts will not be members of any tenant groups, so they will just see 
  the Me and Tapped In tabs. [1]</p>
<p><b>Guest accounts [2]</b></p>
<p>100 guest accounts will be pre-generated with the names Guest1 through Guest 
  100. A &quot;Guest Login&quot; button will appear on the login page, and guests 
  will be assigned one of the available guest accounts [1]. If all 100 accounts 
  are in use, the guest will be told to try again later when guest accounts may 
  be available. [1]</p>
<p>Guest basically have read-only access. Guest accounts will be restricted in 
  several ways: [1]</p>
<p>Guests cannot access any commands that could modify the database.[1] That means, 
  for example, that they will see <b>not</b> be able to do any of the following, 
  and will <b>not</b> see links for any of the following: add favorite places, 
  add or remove buddies, create an office, create or edit a profile, create a 
  group, post to any discussions, upload any files, add any links, add items to 
  a calendar, set up an event, etc. [1]</p>
<p>We may set up certain discussions or events where guests can write as well 
  as read [3]</p>
<p>Guest will see a Tappedin In tab and a Me tab. Guests will not be subscribed 
  to (or be able to subscribe to) any group or be a member of any tenant. [1]</p>
<p>Guests will be able to chat [1] and pm [2] with others. Guests will not receive 
  transcripts, because they have no email address specified. Things that guests 
  say will appear in our regular room transcripts (which are also saved for reseach 
  purposes). [1] </p>
<p>Guests can view most things. For example, they can view files and links and 
  read discussions in public rooms that they enter [1], and search for items[2]. 
  However, guests will never see member email addresses when they click on a member's 
  profiles[1]. They also will not see the link _add &lt;membername&gt; to your 
  buddy list_ [1]</p>
<p>For guests, the Me subtabs will be restricted in the following ways: [1]</p>
<p><b>Welcome</b>. Guests see their login name (GuestX) and a message saying that 
  if they were a regular member, they could create an office and view saved messages 
  here. The _create an office_ link would not appear.</p>
<p><b>People</b>. They will see a buddy list with TI staff listed. A message will 
  appear that if they were a regular member, they could edit and remove buddies 
  here. The _add a buddy_ and _remove_ links would not appear.</p>
<p><b>Places</b>. They will see a favorite places list with the TI reception. 
  A message will appear that if they were a regular member, they could edit and 
  remove favorite places here. The _add favorite places_ and _remove_ links would 
  not appear.</p>
<p><b>Groups</b>. They will see a message that says if they were a regular member, 
  they could view their groups here, and could create up to X of their own groups.</p>
<p><b>Notes</b>. They will see a message that if they were a member, they could 
  have an office and create and edit notes that would appear here and reside in 
  their office.</p>
<p><b>Files</b>. They will see a message that if they were a member, they could 
  have an office and upload files that would appear here and reside in their office. 
  The _add notes here_ link would not appear.</p>
<p><b>Links</b>. They will see a message that if they were a member, they could 
  have an office and create and edit url links that would appear here and reside 
  in their office. The _add files here_ link would not appear.</p>
<p><b>Settings</b>. They would see their login name and a message that if they 
  were a member, they could update their profile and preferences (like their home 
  room and email preferences) here. They would not see any links (e.g., to _change 
  password_, _edit profile_, _edit communication preferences_). They would not 
  see a profile.</p>
