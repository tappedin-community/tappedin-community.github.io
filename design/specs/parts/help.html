If you click on any of those links you are taken to a directory listing of <B>People</B>, <B>Places</B> and <B>Groups</B>.  <br><br>To close the Tapped In Tab, click on the X in the upper left corner of the blue menu or click on the <I>Room View</I> button.  The Tapped In Tab with community information is available to you from any room in the system.  When you click on the Tapped In Tab, you stay in the room you were in when you clicked and have access to this directory information.

If you would like to find out who is a member but not online, click the <I>Show Offline Users</I> link.<br><br>The listing of people shows you, a member's name, username, tenant, and their current location.   You can sort the member directory by any of the linked column headers.  If you sort by tenant, you will see all members affiliated with a tenant sorted alphabetically.  Note, now matter which view of the member directory you take, if the list of members is long, you will only see X (Zaz what is X--25?) members at a time.    <br><br><b>Things to try</b><br> <UL TYPE=DISC>	<LI>If you click on a person's name, you will see basic information about the person.  To get back to the directory of people from information about one person, simply click the Tapped In : People link at the top of the page.  	<LI>If you click on a person's username, you can send them a text message that they will receive when they next log in as a saved message or as email depending on their preference (for information about editing preferences see (link to) the help page for Me-->Settings).  	<LI>You can join a member in their location by clicking on their location listing.

You can also add a note that shows a picture or image (must be gif, png or jpeg).  People only see Notes when they enter your office or the Group room.  There is no way to communicate with people through a Note if they do not normally enter your office or the Group room.

If you own a Group instead of an office you have an office associated with that Group and notes for that Group will be listed there.
