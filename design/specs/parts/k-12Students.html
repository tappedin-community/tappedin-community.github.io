<h2>Student Accounts</h2>
<p><i>Priorities for features indicated in brackets []. Priorities are marked 
  with a 1 (must have); 2 (should have); or a 3 (may have). If a feature is marked 
  but its subfeatures are not, this means that the subfeatures have the same priority 
  as the larger feature. </i></p>
<p><i>Total days of work, estimated: 52 (drops to 32 days if we drop the filtering 
  in chat requirement, which would prohibit interaction with students in SAC public 
  areas anyway). </i></p>
<p><b>Student user information [mostly priority 1]<br>
  </b><i>Estimated days: 2 (fairly straighforward)</i></p>
<p>Student accounts are special accounts that require sponsorship by a regular 
  Tapped In Member [1]. The only required information for a student account is 
  a username and password[1]. The real name and real email address for the student 
  account is optional[1]. If not specified, the real name will be blank and a 
  bogus value will be generated for the email address (Expresso requires that 
  all accounts have email addresses)[1]. A member profile will not be kept for 
  student accounts [1]. </p>
<p>Members and the sponsor/moderators of a student group can see an info page 
  for student accounts, accessible from the About link in the student group room. 
  The student info page will state that the account is a student account, and 
  show the student's username, the group they are a member of, the owner/sponsor 
  of the group, and a real name of the student if the sponsor/moderators have 
  entered one for the student, or the student has set his/her own real name[1].</p>
<p>Student accounts will not be listed in the Tapped In (or any tenant) directory[2]. 
  Students also can not see the regular Tapped In (or any tenant) directory[2].</p>
<p><b>Student and Tapped In member groups, objects, and room access [mostly priority 
  1] <br>
  </b><i>Estimated days: 10 (medium hard, lots of details, touches lots of code, 
  lots to test/debug)</i></p>
<p>Like guest accounts, student accounts can not create groups or have offices[1], 
  and they cannot set their home room[1]. By default, they can create items and 
  upload files to their group room[1]. As in regular group rooms, student group 
  owners/moderators can change individual student member permissions to disallow 
  them adding items, etc.[1].</p>
<p>Student accounts are associated with exactly one (and only one) group room 
  in the Student Activity Center[1]. Student group rooms are always private[1] 
  and reside on the 2nd floor of the SAC[1]. Student groups, being private, do 
  not appear in any group directories[1]; however, they do appear in a Groups 
  listing in the SAC reception[1], even though they are private. Student group 
  rooms always have &quot;(K-12)&quot; automatically appended to the end in any 
  web display.</p>
<p>The owner/sponsor of the student group can also invite regular Tapped In members 
  to join the student group, and can make other regular members moderators of 
  the student group[1]. Tapped In members can not apply to join student groups 
  however; they can only join a student group if they are invited[1].</p>
<p>By default, students can enter their group room at any time, but the sponsor/moderators 
  of the student group can change permissions so that their students can only 
  enter their group room at certain times, like when the sponsor is logged in 
  [3]. </p>
<p>Be default, students can only enter their group room in the SAC[1] and the 
  public rooms (Reception, conference rooms) in the SAC building. Students can 
  never go outside of the Student Activity Center (SAC) building [1]. The sponsor/moderators 
  of a student group can turn off the ability of individual students or their 
  entire student group to access public SAC rooms [3].</p>
<p>Regular Tapped In members can enter the SAC Reception area and the SAC public 
  conference rooms [1]. Guests can not enter the SAC [1].</p>
<p><b>Student and Tapped In member communication [mostly priority 2, some 3, some 
  1] <br>
  </b><i>Esimated days: 29 (transcript work medium hard; differential filtering 
  mechanisms based on relationships, not just class of user, is complex and may 
  require new ommunication protocol)</i></p>
<p>At the end of each day, the group room transcript of chat conversation (if 
  it is not empty) is emailed to the owner of the student group [2]. This email 
  also includes all PMs by all students in the group[2]. Transcripts for the SAC 
  public rooms are also mailed to the public room owner daily [2]. (Est: 7 days 
  to create generic transcript robot that gathers rooms and disparate PM messages 
  on a schedule and parses and mails them)</p>
<p>All users are warned when they enter public SAC rooms that all conversation 
  in the SAC is recorded for liability reasons [2]. (Est 1 day)</p>
<p>Students do not get newsletters/ event mailings or any other community mailing[1]. 
  Students can not change their communication preferences[1] (Est. 1 day)</p>
<p> (Very hard) Students will not be visible in the Online list in the Tapped 
  In directory, except to their particular sponsors/moderators, and to Tapped 
  In staff[3].Students will not be visible to regular Tapped In members in the 
  Online list of the chat room tab, except to their sponsors/moderators and to 
  Tapped In staff[3], Student accounts can not send PMs or saved messages to anyone 
  except the members/sponsors/moderators of the group he/she is in, as well as 
  Tapped In staff[3]. (Est: 20 days if different members have differential ability 
  not based on room or account type,but also by relation of individuals; may need 
  to develop brand new XML protocol between client and server to handle this level 
  of complexity the right way)</p>
<p>Note: If students aren't visible in the online tab, how can other teachers 
  see them and interact with them? Conflicts with earlier requirment that Tapped 
  In members can interact with students in the SAC public rooms. </p>
<p>Suggestion: Drop this feature requirement; it's not worth the extreme effort 
  it will take, and won't allow interaction between Tapped In members and students, 
  which is a stated desired feature.</p>
<p><b>K-12 Students Online Discussion Group for Tapped In Members[priority 2]<br>
  </b><i>Estimated days: 1 (fairly straightforward, need content)</i></p>
<p>A regular Tapped In group named &quot;K-12 students online discussion group&quot; 
  will be created for teachers who manage student accounts. so that teachers with 
  student accounts could talk to each other to exchange ideas, and teachers who 
  are thinking of doing this can learn about it from others who have done this[1]. 
</p>
<p>The group will be seeded with links and notes about activities previous (old) 
  Tapped In members have done with students online, reflection on what was successful, 
  and ideas to try[2]. It will also contain links to the terms of bringing K-12 
  students online[2].</p>
<p>During the process of creating a Tapped In student group, users are asked if 
  they want to join this group[2]. If they choose to join, they will be automatically 
  added as a member[2].</p>
<p><b>Student Group creation[mostly priority 1]<br>
  </b><i>Estimated days: 5 (fairly straightforward but lots of details/steps/debugging)</i></p>
<p>Tapped In members can create a K-12 student group via a new item, &quot;Create 
  a K-12 student group&quot; under the Tapped In Groups subtab as shown below[1]. 
  The &quot;Create a K-12 student group&quot; option only appears under the Tapped 
  In Groups directory; it does not appear under any tenant group directories because 
  student groups are never associated with tenants[1]. </p>
<p>Student groups are always private, and automatically appear on the SAC Group 
  floor upon creation[1].</p>

<p>If the Tapped In member checks the box and clicks continue, they will begin 
  the K-12 student group creation process[1]. The first page will ask them for 
  a group name, a group nickname, how many student accounts should be created 
  (N) and associated with the group, and a 6-letter prefix for the student accounts 
  which will be used to generate N student accounts, and a default password for 
  all of the accounts[1]. Teachers may also optionally join the K-12 Student Online 
  dicussion group[3].</p>

  new student group has been created in the Student Activity Center, and displays 
  a link to the group room[1]. They are told that from the group room, they can 
  optionally configure student accounts by assigning real names and unique passwords 
  to each account[2], and apply to extend the duration of the project from the 
  default (6 months?)[3]</p>
<p>If the user chose to join the K-12 discussion group, the result page will also

<p><b>Modifying accounts [mostly priority 3, some 2]<br>
  </b><i>Estimated days: 5 (fairtly straighforward except for expiration, and

<p>In the student group room, the sponsor/moderators can edit student accounts 
  under a new Edit Student Accounts option under the Settings menu.[2] (Note: 
  consider merging this with the existing Edit membership option?) An edit link 
  appears beside each student username; the sponsor/moderators can click on an 
  edit link to assign a real name to a student account or change the account email 
  address or password[2]. On the page where a teacher submits updated student 
  information, there is also a checkbox asking if they want the new information 
  to be mailed to the student.[3].</p>
<p>Sponsors can also turn on or off transcripts for the student [3]. (Note, the 
  ability to turn on or off transcripts is a general priority 3 Tapped In feature.)</p>
<p>By default, students can not edit their own information, including their real 
  name or email address. They have no Settings subtab under the Me tab[1]. Sponsors/moderators 
  can turn on the ability for students to edit their own information[3].</p>
<p>From the group room Settings menu, the sponsor (only; not the moderators) can 
  also change the expiration date for up to a year later[3]. Two weeks before 
  a student group will be expiring, the sponsor will be sent an email telling 
  them that their group and accounts will go away if they do not extend the duration 
  in the group settings area[3]. If they do not extend, they will be emailed a 
  final reminder 2 days before the group will be deleted (if not renewed)[3].</p>
