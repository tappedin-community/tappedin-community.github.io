<h2>Research Tools</h2>

<p>We need to have all data collected and stored in a
database. We need to talk about the design of the database. A
supporting document called Database fields lists all the current fields in
the current TI database, plus additional ones that we need. The database needs to be designed in a way
that makes more sense to the researchers than the current TI's database. We will need discuss the design. I don't know the best way to design
databases, but I can tell you what has not worked for me and why.  If possible the database should be on a
different server than the one the community is on. The database should collect all commands issued from both
the web interface and the chat interface.
The database should also have demographic information about the members. </p>

<p>We will need Admin Reporting tools and Researcher Reporting
tools. The distinction will be
that Admin Reporting tools will provide summary data and Researcher Reporting
tools will provide raw data.  </p>


<p>We also need a way to look at guests. We won't be able to assume anything
across guest log ins, but we will need a way to count guest log ins, and to
follow what a guest does with in a log in session so that we can learn
something about guests. </p>

<h3>Admin Reporting Tools</h3>

<p>All of the repoting tools should have the ability to be run
by any time frame. Another
dimension that is independent from time frame is that reporting tools should be
able to be run by any location group, room, course, or all of TAPPED IN. For time frame we should be able to
break things down by session, hour, day, week, month or other specified
duration. Session is defined in the Calendar spec. A session has the following fields
associated with it and we should be able to do searches with these fields too:</p>

<ul>
<li>Date of session</li>
<li>Start time and approximateend</li>
<li>Room</li>
<li>Session name</li>
<li>Description</li>
<li>Leader name</li>
<li>keyword categorization (so
people can search and we can sort by keyword)</li>
<li>Group affiliation </li>
</ul>

<p>We will need summary data of people who attended during a
period of time (session, hour, day, week, month, any specified duration). For example, SSF sessions that were
listed on the SSF calendar for June.
The report should have two options, list everyone who attended the
session and not just the members of the SSF group (assuming they are a public
group and anyone can attend their sessions), or just list group members who
attended the session. We also need
to look at just TI members or include guest data too.  <i>By default, summary tools should only provide info about
a group's members to group admin, but it could be an option for them.</i> </p>

<center>
Attendees for SSF sessions June 2002<br>
Judi 3<br>
Melissa 5<br>
Mark 1<br>
  Jenny 0<br>
  <br>
</center>

<p>Notes for me (Judi): Room Activity description (Room list menu and pop up list 
  of session title based on room you select b/c of integration with the calendar 
  and the ability to look by time period e.g., all day January 3, 2002.)</p>

<p>Summary data of what sessions (by name of session in
calendar) people attended. The report should have two options, list everyone
who attended the session and not just the members of the SSF group (assuming
they are a public group and anyone can attend their sessions), or just list
group members who attended the session.</p>

<p>Judi: Smithsonian Website, Civil War, WW II</p>

<p>Melissa: Integrating data into your SS class, Smithsonian
Website, Middle School SS, Civl War, WW II</p>

<p>Mark: Website resources for High School SS teachers</p>

<p>Etc.</p>

<p>Ability to see the time connected for all members over a
period of time for a group or room (day/week/month/any specified duration). The
report should have two options, list everyone who attended the session and not
just the members of the SSF group (assuming they are a public group and anyone
can attend their sessions), or just list group members who attended the
session. In this case' </p>

<center>
Activity in the SSF room for June 2002<br>
Judi: 4 hours 8 minutes<br>
Melissa: 8 hours 6 minutes<br>
Mark: 3 hours 12 minutes<br>
  Jenny: 2 hours 3 minutes<br>
  <br>
</center>

<p>(note: Jenny logged in, but did not attend sessions)</p>

<h3>Other Summary Reports:</h3>

<p>1. Member
Activity looking by group see # of logins, length of time online, # of rooms
visited, # of commands issued (web and chat (talk, who, emote, pm)), # of
people members talked with </p>

<p>2. Object
Activity number of bulletin board posts, # of different bb's posted to, # of
objects uploaded, # of links added, # of files downloaded, # of links clicked
on (e.g., Welcome, Files, Calendars, etc.), # of notes made, # of passageways
created, # of favorite places created. (Guests will not have any capabilities
of creating objects just viewing them. 
We need to track this.)</p>

<p>Discussion Boards:
We will care about how many discussion board (DB) posts were made by a
member, (broken down by discussion board).  Group leaders should be able to see a summary of a group's
activity on a DB.  (Guests can view
DB's but not post right?)</p>

<p>Questions we expect group leaders will want to know the
answers to are:</p>

<ul>
<li> How many posts were made on each DB in all their rooms
and in each room</li>
<li>How many posts were made by each member on the DB in
all their rooms and in each individual room</li>
</ul>

<p>We will also need summary tools for how many emails were
sent through our system if we have this capability.</p>

<p>3. Search
Activity kind of search, number of searches</p>

<p>4. Cumulative
Login Time by Day of Week by rooms or by the whole system</p>

<p>5. Activity
by Day of Week for rooms or for the whole system.  It gives us a printout of the number of members connected by
day of week.  Summary data should
include number of hours connected by day of week totaled over all members.</p>

<p>6. Activity
by Time of Day gives us a printout of the number of members logged in by hour
of day.  (it would be nice if we
could also do this by room.) .  It
helps us know what is happening and when we can schedule maintenance.</p>


<h3>Research Reporting Tools:</h3>

<p>We need to be able to get the types of commands issued by a
person during a specified time frame in a specified room.  </p>

<p>The important thing is that we need to see a listing of all
commands issued by members by any time frame.</p>

<p>Social Network Analysis (SNA) data needs to know who all was
in a room at a given time when someone was speaking. ' In TI the data shows who all was targeted by a
command.  For example, for a PM,
there is only one target.  For an
utterance said aloud in a room, everyone in the room is a target (each “talk”
command issued is in the database X number of times with X being the number of
people in the room when the command was issued).  Note how for ENTER there is no target, but for the other
commands there is a target.  Note
also how Jim is the target of Melissa's PM.  Jim is not in the room, but Melissa is so we see her
targets.</p>

<p>The above table shows how when 3 people are in a room the
data looks like in TAPPED IN.  In
the current system, the database divides commands into different command types
and each command type is it's own table, e.g., communication, object actions,
perceptions, room action (enters and exits).  This type of format makes it difficult to put it all back
together, so if there is a way to do this better that would be great.  Ultimately what we need for SNA is </p>

<p>(The numbers in this table represent a count of the number
of talk communications between the members during a specified amount of time.)</p>

<p>We do have a mode in the current system where we can record
all actions and times and content issued in a room.  The results of that mode are put into a flat file so that
the researcher doesn't have to do multiple queries to reconstruct the
actions.  We have only used this
research mode a few times, but when we have it has been invaluable!' The other advantage of this flatfile
result is that we get content and this database will not need to record
content, just commands issued.  </p>

<p>7. As
mentioned above we need to be able to get data on guests for tracking them with
in a log in session.  We also
should record IP addresses of Guests. 
</p>

<p>8. SQL
query (TI staff only)' We need to
be able to create SQL queries on the fly. 
We should also have the option to save them in the system and have them
in a pop-up menu list or something… (a description of the query would be
helpful too!)</p>

<p>(Do queries like this based on group membership too.)' Administrators can make their own
“group” designation for people to save for future queries.  Add a way to remember the report
configuration so you don't have to check off all the options every time.  </p>

<p><b>More Queries that I do on a regular basis now</b></p>

<p>Note: I am
limited in the kinds of queries I can do currently as I can only join 2 tables
at one time for a query.  There are
some queries that I would like to do that involve joining more than 2 tables
but currently can't because it slows the server down too much.</p>

<p>I need to develop this section.</p>

<hr noshade>

<h3><b>NOTES</b></h3>

<p>Count how many sessions a person has led.  (What kind of sessions, what
organization).  This may be part of
their profile or part of a reputation manager in the future.  Be able to easily count how many people
/ who they are this person has spoken to in their sessions (for SNA stuff).</p>

<p>Give a choice between tab-delimited raw number output and
graphical .gif or whatever format Prometheus/cold fusion uses.  </p>

<p>We don't have a way to easily find out activity in all rooms
associated with Pepperdine.  (I'd
have to go look up all the room numbers and then use them in the query…. We
need to build in a system that shows relationships among rooms.  –Do we assume that people who are with
an org (such as Pepperdine) are doing things unrelated to Pepperdine when they
are in the ASO room?</p>

<p><b>Transcripts</b>: </p>
<p><b>Discussion Boards:</b> </p>
<p>We haven't had discussion boards in the past, but I imagine
organizations would want a way to know who has made how many postings in a
specified timeframe.</p>

<p>Other stuff</p>

<p>It would be nice to know how many members we had on any
given day in the past…' Monthly
stats run and compiled (not just there for the researcher to run, but scripts
that actually summarize)</p>

<p>Easy to print out who is a member of what group.</p>

<p>Easy to see what functions they have attended. And what
rooms they were in .and who they talked with during an allotted time.</p>

<p>The
time connected includes a breakdown of time connected to the synchronous
environment and the asynchronous environment' I think this is no longer relevant as in TI 2.0 we won't
have a way for members to connect and be asynchronous only.  </p>

<p><b>Researcher tools:</b></p>

<p>Many of the Admin tools will also function as researcher
tools, but in addition, researchers will need some special capabilities</p>

<p>In general, content is not collected for research
purposes--transcripts of public utterances are captured for public ASO sessions
and a group decides whether to archive their own discussions--but under some
circumstances it is necessary to collect all utterances (public and private)
with the user's permission for research. 
Also collect ALL commands issued during a certain session (synchronous
and asynchronous commands and the order in which they occurred and time
stamped.)' This would be a complete
log of everything that occurred in the room during the discussion.  For example if a user spoke and then
clicked on the discussion board all this would be recorded as well as the
content of what was spoken and what was read or written to the discussion
board.</p>

<p>(A few more words about the current TAPPED IN's
database…since it divides commands into different command types and puts them
in different tables, it makes it very difficult to get things out of the system
since we can't join tables very easily because it slows the machine down too
much and causes lag in TAPPED IN this is VERY difficult to work with.  Would it be possible to organize the
tables in some other fashion and capture all commands in one table' If it doesn't make sense, we can talk
about the current breakdown, but maybe with Larry's flat file that he's working
on creating that could be emailed things will be better for researchers to look
at data more quickly.)</p>

<p>A break down of commands in the current system:</p>

<p>A way to calculate how active a member is in a log in
session (maybe as simple as dividing # of commands issued by the number issued
in the session).</p>

<p><b>Notes about things that would be very nice to have for members' sake:</b></p>

<p>Email addresses it would be nice to be able to store up to 2
addresses for TI members.  This is
a request we get fairly frequently. 
This will need to go on the registration and settings page.  </p>

<p>The ability for a person to add an alias to use to log
in.  For example, I might want
Hobbes to be the username I remember and not JudiF, but we want people to show
up as FirstnameLastnameInitial.  An
alias allows both of these things to happen.  We could ask people to type in the username they want and
the password they want on the registration page and then create their account
with this information and have their online name show up when they are logged
in.</p>

<p>Should all personal recorders have a time stamp on all
utterances?' Regular members may
not like seeing date time at the beginning of each line.  Could this be an option that could be
turned on/off?</p>

<p>It looks like time is recorded in regular time and not unix
time.  This is GOOD.  Please have time formatted in regular
time and not unix time everywhere in the system!!!' (In old TI there are lots of places where I get unix and
have to convert.)</p>
