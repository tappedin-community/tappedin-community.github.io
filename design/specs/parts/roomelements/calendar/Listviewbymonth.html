  Factory in Estonia, focuses initially on Migration and the role Water plays 
  in the artistic and everyday life of diverse cultures. WaterRoots is the educational 
  component of Leonardo's three-year international project, &quot;The Spirit and 
  Power of Water.&quot; Ms. Phelan and other representatives from FluidArts will 
  be on hand to discuss the work they have done towards creating a 24/7 multilingual 
  student factory and the groundwork they have laid towards the establishment 
  of a multilingual, multi-literate cache of online mentors - SAEs, university 
  students, artists, scientists and educators. Join this discussion on December

  junior and high school students to write their own history of 9/11/01 from any 
  perspective and in any medium they choose. Their works will then be arranged 
  into an online exhibit with some being chosen for display in the museums of 
  the Boston, New York City, and Washington D.C. Historical Societies providing 
  students with access to the works and viewpoints of their peers around the country. 
  Participants in the discussion will include YHP Project Director, Dr. Shigeru 
  Miyagawa of MIT's Foreign Languages and Literatures, and Comparative Media Studies 
  departments, project team member Kimberly Zern, Master's student at Harvard
