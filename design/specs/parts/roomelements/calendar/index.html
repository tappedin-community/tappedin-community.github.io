<P><b>Description from Prometheus:</b></P>
</FONT> 
<P><b><i>Calendar</i></b><i>. The portal calendar is a central place for users 
  to view all events relating to their courses and affinity groups as well as 
  personal events. Calendar features include:</i></P>
<i>* User-defined events</i> <i><br>
* Multi-day events </i> <i><br>
* Timed events </i> <i><br>
* Choice of daily, weekly, monthly, or yearly view</i> 
<P><i>The calendar integrates with session dates from all classes in which a student 
  is enrolled, affinity groups and events, and institutional events.</i> (Is this 
  a choice or by default? I&#146;d like it to be a choice.)</P>

<B> 
<P>The Prometheus calendar experience</P>
</B><FONT FACE="Times"> 
<P>It appears very small when you first view it.  When an event is added, it just makes a link on the date (e.g., if you added an event on the 3<SUP>rd</SUP> the 3 would now be a hot link).  It would be nice to offer members a choice of viewing their calendar weekly, monthly, daily on the first click of their calendar (this is an option at a second click of the calendar currently in Prometheus).  The current Prometheus calendar has no options for emailing users reminders, or adding one event from another calendar to a personal calendar.  </P>

<P>I&#146;m not sure how to get course listings off my calendar.  I thought there was an option that you could turn on/off to indicate what events showed up on your calendar but apparently not.   Apparently it&#146;s that any course event for a course you are enrolled in automatically shows up on your calendar (probably the same if you are in a group with a calendar).  We want it to be an option for users to determine which events from groups/courses show up on their personal calendar.</P>

<P>I really like the functionality in Yahoo Calendar.  There is also a task list function in Yahoo Calendar that I really like!  This may or may not be appropriate/feasible for TI v2.  I will discuss it at the end.</P>

</FONT><B>
<P>Notes for Groups and courses</P>
</B><FONT FACE="Times">
<P>We&#146;ll need to make sure there is a permission setting for groups and courses so that the instructor or owner can give others permission to post and edit the calendar.  </P>

<P>Calendar Goals </P>
</B>
<UL>
<LI>To be a personal calendar and an organizational tool for the community (ASO), groups, and courses.</LI></UL>



<UL>
<LI>The calendar communicates with members via reminders and with other features in the system (e.g., transcript generator).</LI></UL>


<B><P>Organizational Calendar for the Community</P>
</B><P>Each month, TAPPED IN staff recruit and organize volunteer speakers from the community to lead sessions in the TAPPED IN community as ASO sessions.  In the current version of TAPPED IN (MOO) there is a form that potential speakers can fill out under the &quot;community area&quot; on our web site.  In TI2 there will be an option for submitting/suggesting events to the ASO &amp; group calendars in the ASO and group calendar areas.  (Responsibilities for the speaker include prepping for the content of the session, finding / having resources to share, and leading the session during the allotted time.  The leader of the session writes a short description of his/her session and that is stored on the calendar.) </P>

<P>In the new calendar form for TI2 entries should require:</P>

<UL>
<LI>Date of session</LI></UL>


<UL>
<LI>a start time and approximate end time (the calendar converts times to the person&#146;s timezone for them&#150;this information is stored in the profile) (if course or group event or it&#146;s an event that the user wants to be transcribed)  ASO sessions are always transcribed.  More on this later.</LI>
<LI>a room where the event will take place this is important for 3 reasons.  1.  To get the participants to the right place (rooms should be hot linked on the calendar and people should be able to click on them to get to the session), 2.  To turn on the transcript generator, 3. To do searches and counts for our research later.  (The user will be able to select from a list of rooms on the form&#133;the rooms that pop up on the list are rooms that the user has some affiliation with&#133; e.g., belongs to the group or has it on his/her favorites?) (Can users schedule rooms like ASO for their own events?)</LI>
<LI>Session name</LI>
<LI>Description</LI>
<LI>Leader name (can pull Session name for person&#146;s profile&#150;potentially something the mentor application or reputation manager might want.  Should we assume person entering the info is the leader of the session?  &#150;Maybe on the private entry form, but not on the ASO/Group form.)</LI>
<LI>keyword categorization (so people can search and we can sort by keyword)</LI>
<LI>A way to submit an idea/event to the ASO calendar.  (In the current system people are confused about how things get on the ASO calendar.  I want to make this more obvious for members in the new system in an attempt to grow the offerings that the community members make for ASO sessions.)</LI>
<LI>Group affiliation (if an event is submitted to a group calendar then that group is automatically filled in from a hidden field and is the group affiliation.  If a group event also appears on the ASO calendar, this is the group affiliation if it doesn&#146;t also appear on a group calendar&#133;. If it appears on both a group calendar (e.g., Social Studies Forum and ASO calendar, then there are two group affiliations&#150;is this hard for the database? I don&#146;t know if there would ever be more than 2 groups&#133;) </LI></UL>


<P>Group events are input to a group calendar by an administrator of a group (for 
  group events) or input or approved by an administrator of TAPPED IN for the 
  ASO calendar. Members without permission to post to a group calendar can submit 
  from an area on their own personal calendar posting area to group calendars 
  (of groups they belong to) and/or the ASO calendar (see <A HREF="proposeevent.html"><FONT FACE="Times">proposeevent.html</FONT></A><FONT FACE="Times">). 
  This is now a link on the main calendar view for each user now next to the Add 
  personal event link.) I spent some time thinking about this&#133;. I think it 
  makes the most sense in that it&#146;s a different form than the one you use 
  for a personal event that gets added on to your own calendar, it thus shortens 
  both the &quot;add a personal event&quot; input screen and the &quot;propose 
  an event&quot; input screen. It also makes apparent to the members how they 
  can submit ideas/ propose events for the community or a group&#150;hopefully 
  inspiring more people to submit. The moderator of the group or TAPPED IN admin 
  for ASO will approve or not approve the posting. (See </FONT><A HREF="approveevent.html"><FONT FACE="Times">approveevent.html</FONT></A>). 
</P>

<B><P>Transcript Generator</P>
</B> 
<P>If the Group owner chooses to archive an event to the Group room files, 10 
  minutes before the event is to start, automatic transcript capture feature is 
  turned on by the calendar. 15 minutes after the event is scheduled to end, the 
  transcript capture feature is turned off, the transcript is filed. (Will there 
  be a way for the group owner or someone in the room to prevent the automatic 
  turning off of the transcript capture feature in case the session is being much 
  longer than planned and very interesting thing they want archived are being 
  said?)</P>
<P>Each group room will have a designated place for filing transcripts and the 
  ASO room will have transcript library. If a group wants to archive one of their 
  events and it&#146;s also an ASO session, the main copy will be stored in the 
  ASO room and a link will be made to their group transcript library. This is 
  because there will be an expiration date on Group Event transcripts (1 month? 
  3 months?) and no expiration date on ASO sessions. Group Leaders can extend 
  the expiration date, but they still do have a limited quota and the transcripts 
  will use up that quota. Paid tenants can make their expiration date whenever 
  they want by default as long as they don&#146;t exceed their quota. (I&#146;m 
  assuming that paid tenants will have different amounts of quota given what they 
  pay? Something to figure out in the pricing scheme.) Members can go read the 
  event in the transcript library where it is stored or have it emailed to them 
  for reading offline (once emailed, they can keep a copy forever if they like). 
</P>

<P>We decided that Calendar Settings make the most sense to be linked to from the member&#146;s calendar view rather than off of &quot;Me&quot; settings or &quot;room&quot; settings.  </P>

<UL>
<LI>Choose which events for groups / ASO chat types / courses / or even down to the level of assignments or lecture topics are integrated into your calendar</LI>
<LI>In addition, a member can link to one event at a time when he/she is viewing the detailed information about it on a calendar.  This information is explained on the Incorporate Events Settings Web Page.</LI></UL>


<P><b>View of the calendar</b></P>

<UL>
  <LI>Members can see any public group calendar when they enter the group room, 
    any course calendar when they are part of a course, the ASO calendar, their 
    own calendar and an private group calendar when they are part of the group 
    (they have to be part of the private group to enter the private group room). 
    Members can not view other member&#146;s calendars. </LI>
</UL>



<UL>
  <LI>Members see a personalized view of the calendar based on their specifications. 
    The user creates a profile based on subject, grade taught, and interests (a 
    survey that they fill out when they get membership or first log in). There 
    is a button to view all events on the calendar, but for a member who has filled 
    out the profile, the calendar will, by default, show the sessions that match 
    the users preferences and for calendar settings these settings will be pre-configured. 
    For members who have not configured interest settings (can a member join without 
    selecting some interests?) (and for guests) they will just see all events 
    on the calendar they are viewing (See <A HREF="Guestnoprefcalendar.html"><FONT FACE="Times">Guestnoprefcalendar.html</FONT></A><FONT FACE="Times"> 
    for the guest view and </FONT><A HREF="calendarview.html"><FONT FACE="Times">calendarview.html</FONT></A> 
    for the member view). </LI>
</UL>



<UL>
  <LI>When a user has created an event for his/her calendar it shows up as a hot 
    link on the date of the event. When the event hot link is clicked, the user 
    gets taken to the form for editing/inputting a new event (See <A HREF="popupcalendardetailprivate.html"><FONT FACE="Times">popupcalendardetailprivate.html</FONT></A><FONT FACE="Times">). 
    The user thus has access to all the relevant information and can also change 
    it. For events that are incorporated to the users calendar from other calendars 
    when the user clicks on those events he or she is taken to a read only form 
    with more information about the event. (See </FONT><A HREF="popupcalendardetailASO.html"><FONT FACE="Times">popupcalendardetailASO.html</FONT></A>). 
    (I envision viewing both the personally created events and the incorporated 
    events in a pop-up window.)</LI>
</UL>



<UL>
  <LI>When looking at any calendar the user can add any individual event to his 
    or her calendar even if he or she does not link to the calendar or normally 
    incorporate events from that calendar. There will need to be an add event 
    to my calendar button associated with every event. (Not sure whether this 
    should go on the overall view of the calendar or the description of the event 
    that the user would get if he or she clicked to read more about the event. 
    I think the latter.) The user can also choose if he/she wants a reminder for 
    the event. (See <A HREF="SSFcalendar.html"><FONT FACE="Times">/SSFcalendar.html</FONT></A> 
    and click on event to see what the details look like.) </LI>
</UL>



<UL>
  <LI>Members can choose to have the calendar email them a reminder for sessions 
    that they selected in the calendar. By default the calendar does not email 
    any reminders with the exception of an event that the member is a leader of. 
    See above under Personal settings or <A HREF="settings.html"><FONT FACE="Times">settings.html</FONT></A> 
    for details about the email settings. Email reminders can be set for any event 
    on the calendar&#150;including an event input by a member (see next bullet). 
    Email reminders can be set to be sent 5 minutes prior to the event to 1 week 
    prior to the event based on users&#146; preference. Members can also choose 
    to have the calendar PM them.</LI>
</UL>



<UL>
  <LI>Members can input personal events into their own view of the calendar and 
    invite other TAPPED IN members / groups to attend their event through when 
    they create or edit an event on their calendar. Events that are input by members 
    on their personal calendar only show up on that personal calendar unless others 
    who were invited choose to add the event to their calendar too. A member who 
    was invited to an event that was only on another member&#146;s calendar (not 
    a group / course or other public calendar) would get an &quot;approve event 
    form&quot; much like the one the Group or ASO calendar owner would receive. 
    The member would be notified of the invitation in a Private Message and could 
    click on a link in the private message to get to the &quot;approve event&quot; 
    form (see <A HREF="inviteapprove.html"><FONT FACE="Times">inviteapprove.html</FONT></A><FONT FACE="Times">). 
    (See </FONT><A HREF="inputnewevent.html"><FONT FACE="Times">inputnewevent.html</FONT></A> 
    for a mockup of the input screen that creates the invite.)</LI>
</UL>



<UL>
  <LI>Members who have permission to post to group calendars can input directly 
    to the calendar and also submit the event to other Group calendars (of groups 
    they belong to) for consideration of posting to the other owners. When the 
    event is submitted the owner/moderators will get a PM and be notified and 
    can then communicate with the submitter of the event see<A HREF="approveevent.html"><FONT FACE="Times"> 
    approveevent.html</FONT></A>. I&#146;m not sure if there will be more forms 
    to support the communication or if the moderator of the calendar will need 
    to email the submitter&#133; I need some help in thinking through this.)</LI>
</UL>



<UL>
<LI>When a member joins a group he or she has the option of having all of the group&#146;s events show up on his or her calendar or configuring accordingly.  Would this be something that appears on a &quot;joining a group screen&quot; Melissa? (Could this be overridden by a tenant organization e.g., NCREL wants to have all their calendar events show up on their user&#146;s calendars?).</LI></UL>



<UL>
<LI>Members can turn on/off the ability to view events at any time through Incorporate Events settings.   (How does this relate to the bullet above?  Maybe the Tenant group could turn it on by default but the member can still turn it off.)</LI></UL>



<UL>
  <LI>There will be a &quot;filter view&quot; on the calendar so that members 
    can view just ASO events on their calendar, or just personal events, or just 
    course events&#133; See <A HREF="calendarview.html"><FONT FACE="Times">calendarview.html</FONT></A>. 
  </LI>
</UL>



<UL>
  <LI>Members who are enrolled in classes have the option of having class events 
    show up on their calendar. Members can also choose which type of class events 
    are shown on their calendar, e.g., assignment due dates, class meetings, etc. 
    (These options are shown on the settings page <A HREF="incorporateevents.html"><FONT FACE="Times">incoporateevents.html</FONT></A>)</LI>
</UL>



<UL>
  <LI>Day, week, Year, and List View as indicated on <A HREF="calendarview.html"><FONT FACE="Times">calendarview.html</FONT></A><FONT FACE="Times"> 
    still need to be worked out. I&#146;m envisioning a very standard day, and 
    week view of the calendar (see Yahoo Calendar for what those look like). I&#146;m 
    not sure if a Year view makes sense. The &quot;list view&quot; is a new view 
    that I envision that just lists each session and it&#146;s description NOT 
    in a calendar format. The list view will look more like </FONT><A HREF="http://www.tappedin.org/info/calendar/jan02.html"><FONT FACE="Times">http://www.tappedin.org/info/calendar/jan02.html</FONT></A> 
    and is a low priority! </LI>
</UL>


<B> 
<P>Calendar tool related to the database/Admin Researcher Tools.</P>
</B><FONT FACE="Times"> 
<P>Something to keep in mind&#133;The data base should be structured so that queries 
  can be made so that it is easy to determine WHO attended WHAT calendered events. 
</P>
<P>(What are the criteria to consider someone attended a given event? The person 
  added the event to her calendar? She entered the event room during the scheduled 
  event time? What is she entered the room only 1 second? Maybe she was 'on her 
  way' to another room? or joined by mistake? Events as perceived by the program 
  have little or no context unlike events as perceived by a human being.)</P>
<P>This should be done for all calendars. It&#146;s important to know what events 
  took place, but also who attended. Queries on Leader of the event are important 
  as well (but Leader is a field associated with the calendar). One of the most 
  tedious things we do in the current version of TAPPED IN is try and determine 
  who attended what event. Since the TAPPED IN system database will have the concept 
  of &quot;event&quot; (or time during which an event is occurring, it should 
  be much easier to do queries to find out who was in the room during that event. 
  Of course, queries should be able to be done on Calendar related fields. </P>
</FONT><B> 
<P>Things to think about for the calendar</P>
</B><FONT FACE="Times"> 
<P>Do we want to incorporate a &quot;repeating event&quot; feature into the calendar? 
  Many calendars have this&#133; Yahoo does&#133; Palm calendar does&#133;This 
  might be a V3 feature although it could be very useful for TI staff b/c we have 
  quite a few repeating events on the ASO calendar (e.g., Tips and Tours of TAPPED 
  IN). This is a priority 2 feature and would be great if we can have it!</P>
<P>From Yahoo Calendar:</P>
<P><IMG SRC="Image1.gif" WIDTH=427 HEIGHT=117></P>
<P>Do we create email versions of the calendar for ASO calendars anymore or do 
  we just email a general announcement saying that a new ASO calendar is up? Or 
  do we email a person about the sessions that are occurring that are in the area 
  that the person has specified a preference in? (Judi would like to do the latter 
  option. Janus and Patti vote for just emailing a URL; the ASO calendars are 
  already really long and will likely get longer; let the user click to a URL 
  if they're interested instead of a long spammy message) </P>
<P>Task List Feature:</P>
<P>Like the to-do list feature in the Palm. Below is Yahoo&#146;s interface for 
  editing tasks. The task list just shows up to the left of the calendar in their 
  interface&#133; and I was surprised that when I added a due date on my task, 
  it didn&#146;t also put it on my calendar. It just now listed the due date on 
  my task list. I thought that the calendar and task list would be more integrated 
  and show me when things from my task list were due. </P>
<P>Janus notes that if there are group tasks lists it would be good to have an 
  interface to assign tasks to people, and maybe the people who have been assigned 
  a task to could add updates / status reports on the task (and this could be 
  reflected in the task list, like: 50% in the done column.</P>
</FONT><FONT FACE="Times" SIZE=2> 
<P><IMG SRC="Image2.gif" WIDTH=426 HEIGHT=156></P>
</FONT><FONT FACE="Times"> 
<P>Extra stuff for me.</P>
<P>Check to see if Prometheus does have a way for exporting Calendar to Palm&#133; 
  I did this, and didn&#146;t see anything about this in the current version of 
  Prometheus. I don&#146;t think this is a high priority feature&#133; If it&#146;s 
  one that they create great, but if not, then we can live without it!</P>
