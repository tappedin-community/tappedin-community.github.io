<p>This window will be a pop-up window which will allow a user to configure the 
  calendar view in their office... There will obviously be different windows for 
  the different types of calendars but for ease of mocking up I just put all the 
  types in this one window and you can pretend there are different windows :-).</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>By default for the ASO calendar the user will have all of his her keywords 
  from their profile checked and sessions that have those keywords checked on 
  the input screen will show up in their calendar view. If a user only wants to 
  add only one event from a calendar at a time they will be instructed to go to 
  the actual ASO calendar and add the event to their calendar (Should there be 
  a link here to the ASO calendar?)</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Group Calendars may or may not have keywords associated with their events.... 
  or they may all have the same keyword associated (e.g., social studies) so there 
  may be nothing to configure (it would be all or nothing then). The user once 
  again will be instructed to go to the specific group calendar to add events 
  one at a time to their calendar.(Should there be a link here to the specific 
  groupcalendar?)</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>NCREL Calendar (or other Tenant organization) May or may not have subdivided 
  their events... But they may have... For example NCREL may have Engauge events 
  and Math Club events... (dunno). I guess if they have &quot;multiple rooms&quot; 
  they will have multiple types of events. It seems like they should also have 
  an overall calendar which incorporates all their events (from all the different 
  rooms and groups working in their room) into one place. The user once again 
  will be instructed to go to the specific Tenant calendar to add events one at 
  a time to their calendar.(Should there be a link here to the Tenant calendar?)</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The Courses Calendar view will allow the user to configure course sessions 
  to appear, or tests and assignment due dates to appear or if they want to add 
  only one event from a course at a time they will be instructed to go to the 
  actual course calendar and add the one event to their calendar (Should there 
  be a link here to the Course calendar?)</p>
