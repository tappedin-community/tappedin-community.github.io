<h3>Discussion in a room</h3>
<p>Individual Rooms can have one discussion board [2]. Group rooms have one by 
  default [1]. Owners of individual rooms can get a discussion board on request.[2]</p>
<p>If a visitor visits the Discussion page on a room before a discussion board 
  has been created, they will see a message that &quot;A discussion board has 
  not yet been created for this office&quot;. </p>
<p>To set up a discussion board, the owner of an room can click on the Discussion 
  link; if a discussion does not already exist, they can click on the Create discussion 
  board button.</p>

<p>Once a discussion board has been created, it will appear in this area for all 
  users.[1] Prometheus comes with discussion board support, and we will likely 
  replicate much of the same functionality that Prometheus already offers.</p>
<p>However, the Prometheus discussion board interface in non-standard and pretty 
  ugly. I suggest that we model our interface after better designs such as <a href="http://www.jivesoftware.com/">Jive's 
  software's</a> discussion board (see example below) which offers a clear, simple 
  interface that is well-liked by users.</p>
<table width="100%" border="0" cellspacing="2" cellpadding="5">
  <tr> 
    <td width="21%"><img src="discussionview.gif" width="137" height="305"></td>
    <td width="79%" valign="top"> 
      <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"><b>Discussion</b><br>
        </font></p>
      <p><img src="discussionboard.gif" width="546" height="249"> </p>
    </td>
  </tr>

<p>Our discussion board will offer the standard discussion board features, including</p>
<ul>
  <li>The ability to post new messages and reply to existing messages in a thread 
    [1] </li>
  <li>Posters are easily identified [1]</li>
  <li>Topics can be displayed in threaded or flat mode.[2]</li>
  <li> Users can subscribe to topics and receive optional email updates when the 
    topics are updated.[2]</li>
</ul>
<p>Future releases may support upload of files [3], marking of posts as favorites 
  that are saved under Me [2], marking of users as favorites to be notified when 
  they post something new [3].</p>
