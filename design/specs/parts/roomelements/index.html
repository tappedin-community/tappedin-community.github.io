<small><i>Priorities for features indicated in brackets []. Priorities are marked 
with a 1 (must have by Sept 2002); 2 (should have by December 2002); or a 3 (may 
have my June 2003). If a feature is marked but its subfeatures are not, this means 
that the subfeatures have the same priority as the larger feature.</i></small> 
<p>Every member of TAPPED IN can apply for their own personal office in TAPPED 
  IN. There are many things that a member can do in their office. For example, 
  they can hold private meetings, remodel it by selecting a new look from the 
  themes provided in their room settings, and store resources like files and web 
  links. </p>
<p><b>Getting a room</b></p>
<p>Every member of TAPPED IN can have their own private office<b> [1]</b>. Members 
  must apply for offices; they are not created by default when a member joins 
  TAPPED IN. Documentation on how to create or apply for a new office will be 
  available in the TAPPED IN reception and help pages.<b> [1]</b></p>
<p>A member can have only one TAPPED IN office. A member can own multiple rooms, 
  though, if they apply for and create a group (groups are rooms) or course (courses 
  are rooms too).</p>

  appear (Quick Look is for courses and groups only). Notice that the edit, hide, 
  and unlock options are available; these are only available to the owner of a 
  room, not visitors.</p>
