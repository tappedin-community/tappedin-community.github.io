<p><b>Search</b></p>
<p><b>MAIN SEARCH </b></p>
<p>See<a href="searchmain.html"> searchmain.html</a></p>
<p> Search of all of TI is a simple text box that appears at the top of all pages. 
  Keyword searching of the entire site is possible from this search text box. 
  Next to this search box, there is a pull down menu where the user can specify 
  which media they wish to search. The default is "All". </p>
<p><b>POWER SEARCH </b></p>
<p>See <a href="advancedsearch.html">advancedsearch.html</a></p>
<p>Also next to the search box, there is a link to a Power Search /Advanced Search. 
  The Power Search enables the user to specify more than one media type, subject 
  area, and grade level. These areas for subjects and grade indicators are ways 
  of categorizing the information that the TI staff formalizes and updates based 
  on input from users indicating the keywords they would use to categorize their 
  entries. The system should enable searching of all existing and future media 
  types. Current media types include: </p>
<ul>
  <li><font face="Times">Public groups</font></li>
  <li><font face="Times">Files</font></li>
  <li><font face="Times">Web sites</font></li>
  <li><font face="Times">Members</font></li>
  <li><font face="Times">Mentors</font></li>
  <li><font face="Times">Message Boards</font></li>
  <li><font face="Times">Chat logs</font></li>
  <li><font face="Times">Help files</font></li>
  <li><font face="Times">Currently, courses are not searchable in the Prometheus 
    system since they are not made public. We may want to consider having a listing 
    of courses with the option of faculty listing their member name and email 
    address to be contacted.</font></li>
</ul>
<p>Currently, courses are not searchable in the Prometheus system since they are 
  not made public. We may want to consider having a listing of courses with the 
  option of faculty listing their member name and email address to be contacted. 
</p>
<p>The default setting is "All media types". As soon as a user selects a specific 
  media type, the search page reflects that only specified media types will be 
  searched. </p>
<p><b>KEYWORDS</b> </p>
<p>see <a href="Keywords.html">Keywords.html</a></p>
<p>Keyword searches will follow Boolean logic; the default separator between multiple 
  words will be "and". Common Keyword listings will contain TI staff specified 
  categories and keywords. These keywords can be updated based on how users categorize 
  their entries (documents, web sites, profiles, etc.) </p>
<p><b>RESULTS</b></p>
<p> See <a href="searchresults.html">searchresults.html</a></p>
<p>Results are ordered by percentage of match to search string, with greatest 
  match appearing first. The media type is named next to each entry except if 
  the search is only on one media type. The entry links to the result. Users can 
  easily refine their search from this search results page. "New search" is also 
  context specific, if a context was indicated other than "All" in the original 
  search, it is still marked in the pull down menu. The user can change this setting 
  if they decide to do a new search. </p>
<p><b>CONTEXT-SPECIFIC SEARCHES </b></p>
<p>Each media type has a search specific to its content, accessible from ?? (Aaron’s 
  design to clarify). The label of the search (i.e. Search People) indicates over 
  what content the search is being performed. From the Power Search/Advanced Search, 
  users can broaden the search to include other media or they can go to the top 
  of the page where the Main Search is always accessible. </p>
<p><b>BROWSE </b></p>
<p>All of the media types can be browsed as well as searched. The Browse features 
  should be near the search feature for both Main Search and Context-specific 
  Searches. (Aaron’s design to clarify). </p>
