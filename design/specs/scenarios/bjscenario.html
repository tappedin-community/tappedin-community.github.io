<P>BJ Berquist</P>
<P>Kismet, the hand of fate, plays an active role in BJ's life.  Every day brings new and wondrous experiences!  Kismet brought BJ to the Loysville Youth Development Center where she has taught art for 17 years.  Kismet led her to the TAPPED IN environment 3.5 years ago.  Kismet even anchors the tightrope of the technology integration learning on which BJ precariously teeters.  With very little online communication experience and very few computer skills BJ's first involvement with the TAPPED IN community was with the Civil Rights Forum in 1998.  Intrigued by the possibilities the environment could offer, BJ went on to lead a couple of After School Online discussions, participate in several other scheduled discussions on a variety of topics, and become a HelpDesk volunteer.  She now leads three monthly discussions - PAarts, ArtsSites, and the Alternative/Correctional Ed Discussion Group, as well as volunteers at the HelpDesk and leads the monthly WaterCooler Confab, a forum for HelpDesk volunteers.  She also edits the TAPis newsletter and the monthly TAPPED IN Calendar of events.</P>

<P>Scenario 1</P>

<P>BJ subscribes to several educational and arts related listserves.  Her relationship with the lists is symbiotic.  The information shared on the lists is thought provoking and stimulating.  The lists also provide an opportunity for sharing the weekly scheduled events at TAPPED IN with members of the education community who may not receive the monthly Events Calendar email.  One of these lists is the Electronic Media Interest Group (EMIG), a subgroup of the National Arts Education Association.  BJ joined this list at the recommendation of a TAPPED IN member participating in an ArtsSites discussion.  On a parallel thread of Kismet, the Chair of EMIG, Anna Martin, found out about TI through a presentation that Mark Schlager gave at a conference.  Anna and BJ met when Anna logged in to TAPPED IN and BJ was on the HelpDesk.  </P>

<P>Anna has great vision and wants to make a difference to the children of the world.  She presented the idea of a quilt project to BJ and the two collaborated in TAPPED IN to start the planning process.  At this point "Blanket the World with Peace" is in the very beginning planning stages.  Arts Educators have been invited to join in the planning at an ArtsSites discussion in August.  The theme is peace through the resolution of conflict.  The original idea was to just create an electronic quilt made up of digital images of quilt squares representing the theme and submitted by arts educators and their classes.  However, BJ envisions this project on a much more interdisciplinary multimedia level.  (Here's that old tightrope of precarious balance again!)  Anna suggested that each electronic quilt square could be linked to the contributing school's home page.  BJ would like to integrate language arts, social studies, and all the arts into the project and have the links to the school pages include multimedia presentations of poetry, music, dance and theater with the peace through the resolution of conflict theme.</P>

<P>The key to the success of this project will be communication...letting people know about the project, setting ground rules, jurying the entries, and maintaining a level of enthusiastic involvement.  TAPPED IN is an important part of the whole and will serve as the hub of the project.  Arts organizations, schools, and other participants will be the spokes necessary to implement the creation of the quilt contributions.  There may also be a need to find funding to help support this effort as Anna and BJ would like to have well known professional artists such as Faith Ringgold create a sample quilt square.</P>

<P>Scenario 2</P>

<P>BJ will be participating in the Governor's Institute for Arts Educators in Erie, Pennsylvania. (She regrets deeply that she is unable to be two places at one time!)  The conference addresses a different standard of the proposed PA Arts and Humanities Standards.  Last year's conference focused on the use of technology to meet the standards.  BJ believes passionately that one of the important roles of TAPPED IN is to enable the dialogue to continue after the f2f conferences conclude.  With the help of TAPPED IN staff, she established a mail list within TAPPED IN to facilitate this continuity.  She also started the monthly discussion group, PAarts, to demonstrate interdisciplinary arts integration.  A Backflip site of resources was also created to provide resources for this group.  Participation in the list and the discussion group is not limited to Pennsylvania arts educators and in reality, very few PA arts educators actually contribute, but BJ is a cockeyed optimist and continues to speak up and out!  This year's conference is on the Historical and Cultural Contexts and BJ is hoping to develop some interest in participation in the social studies forums at TAPPED IN.  You can be guaranteed that TAPPED IN will be a very visible presence at the Governor's Institute for Arts Educators!</P>

<P>Scenario 3</P>

<P>The Alternative/Correctional Education Discussion Group was created on a theme similar to Scenario 2.  Originally, BJ had a co-host to this discussion group, but is now leading the discussion alone due to schedule conflicts for the co-host.  One of the primary motivations for BJ in joining TAPPED IN was the isolation that educators can experience in a classroom...this is amplified in the correctional setting.  Thinking that others might share in the desire to communicate with colleagues and discuss specific alternative/correctional education issues, this Special Interest Group (SIG) was created.  It too, has a mail group within the TAPPED IN environment.  The Correctional Education Association (CEA) is the primary organization for this group of teachers and has regions in the US and internationally.  They have a listserve to which BJ posts the monthly TI meetings.  The CEA home page has a place for links to the different US and International regional associations.  When last checked, that page linked to two web pages.  BJ is working with a colleague at the Loysville Youth Development Center and the Director of the Pennsylvania CEA to establish a Pennsylvania CEA web page which will link to a LYDC page.  It is hoped that the individual correctional facilities in PA will be inspired to contribute pages of their own.  This web page effort will be presented at the Juvenile PA CEA conference at Penn State in late fall of 2001.  Updates on the project will be posted to the lists and discussed at the Alt/Correctional Ed Group monthly meetings.</P>
