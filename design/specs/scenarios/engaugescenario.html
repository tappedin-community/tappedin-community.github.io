<P>Sample Scenario enGauge: Jean Poole</P>

<TABLE BORDER CELLSPACING=1 CELLPADDING=5 WIDTH=490>
<TR><TD WIDTH="70%" VALIGN="TOP">
<P>Jean Poole is an ex-biology teacher who holds the position of district technology coordinator at a rural school district in the Midwest. Jean has been technology coordinator for five years. She earned her M.Ed. in instructional technology six years ago. She has been asked to involve her district in conducting an evaluation of her district&#146;s technology integration. Her district will join with seven other districts in using the enGauge online evaluation system to help them gain a perspective on technology integration in their district by gathering information from various stakeholder groups. </TD>
<TD WIDTH="30%" VALIGN="TOP">
<P>Background: Main actor, Jean, her role, technology usage, and how she came to be a member of the TAPPED IN community for the enGauge support system.</P>
<P>Context:enGauge support system </P>
<P>Time period: 4 months</TD>
</TR>
<TR><TD WIDTH="70%" VALIGN="TOP">
<P>After initial rollout, Jean must prepare her district for participating in the enGauge online evaluation. She searches the enGauge Library for guidelines and suggestions on how to select participants and prepare them for taking the online survey. After the surveys are completed, she takes part in a synchronous conference moderated by NCREL. She is able to use instant messaging to contact any of the project leaders. </TD>
<TD WIDTH="30%" VALIGN="TOP">
<P>Activities: synchronous events; asynchronous enGauge support; </P>
<P>instant messaging to keep in touch with other project leaders.</TD>
</TR>
<TR><TD WIDTH="70%" VALIGN="TOP">
<P>Jean is able to share problems and solutions with other project leaders. Working together, they are able to develop strategies for improving technology integration in their respective districts.</TD>
<TD WIDTH="30%" VALIGN="TOP">
<P>Objective: Guiding the data collection and analysis project.</TD>
</TR>
<TR><TD WIDTH="70%" VALIGN="TOP">
<P>Jean likes being able to share with similar districts through the asynchronous discussions and synchronous virtual conferences. She likes being able to retrieve bookmarks to discussion board postings that seem relevant to a rural district like hers. Some of the districts are suburban or urban. Some of the issues that these districts discuss do not apply to her districts, so she only bookmarks what she thinks she can use. </TD>
<TD WIDTH="30%" VALIGN="TOP">
<P>Feature: Searching with bookmarks helps her find relevant information quickly, without having to scan through a lot of postings. She can also share resources with other project leaders.</TD>
</TR>
<TR><TD WIDTH="70%" VALIGN="TOP">
<P>The synchronous discussions really allow her to get some synergy working with others involved in enGauge. To attend conferences some distance away would be costly to her district and waste many hours driving and flying to locations that were centrally located. Her district would only be able to afford one such meeting. She has had seven synchronous meetings with the other districts via Tapped In</TD>
<TD WIDTH="30%" VALIGN="TOP">
<P>Feature:  Synchronous meetings and interaction give a sense of interactivity and immediacy, without the cost and time of travel.</TD>
