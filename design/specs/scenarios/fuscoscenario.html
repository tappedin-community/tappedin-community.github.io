<FONT FACE="Times New Roman,Times"><P>MichaelH is a middle school math teacher who has been teaching seventh and eighth-grade math for nine years.  He has been a member of TAPPED IN for about a year, since he decided to go back to school to get his masters degree through StateU&#146;s online masters degree program.  As a TAPPED IN tenant, StateU uses TAPPED IN&#146;s course delivery and community platform for all its teacher education courses.  When Michael applied to the online program he was familiar with email and did occasional web searches for resources for his lessons. Michael chose the online masters degree program because he felt it would allow him to apply what he is learning in the program in his day job as a full-time classroom teacher.</FONT></TD>

<FONT FACE="Times New Roman,Times"><P>In the MA program, Michael meets with instructors, visiting scholars, and members of his cohort for synchronous class seminars and study group meetings at least two nights a week.  He is also an avid participant in (asynchronous) course discussions, and he occasionally answers math-related questions posted by other students in the program on the <I>Peer-to-Peer</I> Q&amp;A forum. Michael has the TAPPED IN instant message interface on his computer during planning periods and when he is online at home for quick conversations with other&#146;s who might be &quot;on campus.&quot;</FONT></TD>

<FONT FACE="Times New Roman,Times"><P>Michael has accumulated a large collection of digital resources for his final project in his TAPPED IN office, which he can access from any computer, whether in his middle school classroom, StateU&#146;s physical campus, or at home.  He has organized several types of resources in virtual file cabinets and folders (documents, transcripts, links to web sites, and discussion postings).  He can't imagine how he could organize and access all the information without his virtual office. </FONT></TD>
<TD WIDTH="28%" VALIGN="TOP">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman,Times"><P>Objective: Storing, organizing, and accessing the resources and discussion postings he has collected during his graduate program.</FONT></TD>
</TR>
<TR><TD WIDTH="72%" VALIGN="TOP">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman,Times"><P>Michael particularly likes the ability to bookmark discussion board postings. With a click of a "save to folder&#133;" button, Michael stores a link to a posting in his own filing cabinet.  He tries to be selective and not bookmark every post, just the ones that he thinks he might someday want to refer to.  In the beginning he bookmarked more posts and worried that he had too many to be useful, but he has found that the searching features in the system are quite powerful and help him find what he&#146;s looking for when he can&#146;t remember where he filed something.  Sometimes during his study group meetings, he does a quick search of his own resources and projects a relevant posting or web site to the group for discussion. Michael takes a few moments to walk the group through the web site that he has found useful. Sally, a participant in the study group, likes the resource so she files it in her office quickly for later reference.</FONT></TD>
<TD WIDTH="28%" VALIGN="TOP">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman,Times"><P>Feature: Office as an organizational metaphor. Linking to discussions to save &quot;golden nuggets&quot;  in the discussion and are hard to find later.</P>
<P>Search helps him when his organization system breaks down.</P>
<P>Feature: Share resources with others. Guide others through resource. Allow others to file the resource in their offices.</FONT></TD>

<TR><TD WIDTH="72%" VALIGN="TOP">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman,Times"><P>Michael is glad that he will be able to keep the office after he graduates because after completing his MA, the district office has asked if he will conduct online professional development courses for other teachers and he plans to make good use of the office and resource collection he has built.  </FONT></TD>
<TD WIDTH="28%" VALIGN="TOP">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman,Times"><P>Feature:  Support and resource infrastructure does not go away after graduation. </FONT></TD>
