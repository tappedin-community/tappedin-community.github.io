<FONT FACE="Times New Roman,Times"><P>Elaine Marquez is a fifth grade emergency permit teacher just beginning her first year of teaching. She feels discouraged by her lack of skill in classroom management and at a loss about how to teach reading to her sixth grade students--many of whom are English Language Learners.  She receives a brochure about the STELLAR Online program (Supporting Teachers of English Learners in Language and Reading) offered by the Distributed Learning Unit at the Los Angeles County Office of Education.  The brochure explains that STELLAR is a program that trains new teachers in reading and ELL strategies, as well as classroom management.  The training is delivered entirely online through a Web-based course.  Elaine also learns that most of the teachers who have taken the course are still actively engaged in the STELLAR learning community, sharing and exchanging ideas about reading, teaching, and learning.  Though Elaine is a relative newcomer to technology, she recently purchased a new computer for her home, a 56K modem, and has an AOL account.  She enjoys communicating with her friends and relatives through email and occasionally conducts web searches on topics of interest.  Elaine is desperate and decides to take the risk and enroll in the STELLAR Online program.  She feels the anywhere, anytime structure of the course will fit her busy schedule and allow her to participate in the program before and after school and during the evenings.  She feels that the course activities described in the brochure will directly contribute to her classroom needs--lesson planning, using assessment tools to inform instruction, and learning to use a wide variety of reading strategies--all skills that she can immediately apply in her classroom.</FONT></TD>

<FONT FACE="Times New Roman,Times"><P>Three weeks before her STELLAR online course begins, she receives a welcome email from Rebecca, the course instructor, and a well-known expert in reading instruction. The welcome letter offers basic orientation information for students and invites Elaine to visit the Web site and take the orientation tour, "Getting Started," so she can become familiar with the course tools and the other participants in the program.  The welcome message also informed her that she will be receiving course materials by U.S. mail--a set of eight videos on reading instruction and a binder of reading assessment tools, rubrics, graphic organizers, articles, etc.  Elaine feels encouraged by the community feeling engendered by the STELLAR Online home page.  She is amazed at the quality and quantity of the postings in the community discussion board.  As she works through the "Getting Started" orientation, she is happy to learn that her browser and computer have passed "inspection" and meet the minimum technology requirements.  One of the activities in Getting Started directs her to the course discussion board where she learns to post an introduction and short bio about herself.  She reads the introductions of the other participants who have posted and is surprised at the wide geographic area from which they have been drawn.</FONT></TD>

<FONT FACE="Times New Roman,Times"><P>Elaine begins her online course and enters her personalized learning space whenever she logs into her course.  She is happy that she can access her course from any computer, whether in her school classroom, the computer lab, or at home.  She likes the way the course is organized in a week-by-week format, which includes clear directions and an interface that with all the tools and resources she will need for each module--the interface connects all the individual components into a meaningful whole.  Each week begins with a short overview, the instructor's expectations, activities, reflection questions, and links to additional related resources.  The interface includes tools for discussion, email, an electronic journal, chat rooms, and a student presentation area for turning in assignments and sharing presentations.  She realizes that all the documents, tools, articles, and forms in her binder are also available online, both linked in the weekly modules and in the community library in a database searchable by keyword, grade level, type of resource, topic, and state and national standards. </FONT></TD>

<FONT FACE="Times New Roman,Times"><P>Elaine read over the reflection questions in Week One's activities before watching Video #1: "Oral Language," assigned for that week.  After her kids are in bed, she watches the video and is delighted at the quality of the classroom ideas and strategies that are demonstrated for reading instruction. She enjoys the different perspectives that are offered in the related teacher, student, and scholar interviews.  After viewing the video, she writes her reflections in her journal, guided by the reflection questions.  Several nights later, she shares excerpts from her journal in response to the prompts in the asynchronous discussion board.  She then read through other participants' postings and responds to several of their reflections.  The next time she goes online, a message alerts her that someone had replied to her posting.  She is intrigued by the comment and expands on her original thoughts and responds to a question.  As she reads through the new postings, she is excited by some of the reading strategies and classroom management ideas that the other participants have shared. Elaine soon finds she looks forward to reading the new postings in the discussion board and trying out new ideas in her classroom. Elaine particularly likes being able to search the discussion postings to find specific topics, strategies or ideas whenever she needs them and to compile them into a text document to print out and save for later.  On a regular basis, the full-time STELLAR Cybrarian "harvests" the wealth of ideas and adds them to the searchable database in the STELLAR community library.</FONT></TD>

<FONT FACE="Times New Roman,Times"><P>Because Elaine is a novice technology user, she requested a technology buddy when she first registered for the program.  Her technology buddy, Jeannetta, is also a beginning teacher, but an expert technology user.  Elaine feels comfortable asking Jeannetta questions about technology issues, although she knows she can get help anytime from the helpdesk staff through telephone, email, virtual office hours, and the many FAQs.  She also knows there is a helpdesk discussion board where she can post technology questions and receive answers within 24 hours.  However, she likes working with Jeannetta who is also an AOL user and can help Elaine through the problems that most AOL users encounter.</FONT></TD>

<FONT FACE="Times New Roman,Times"><P>Each module of the online course involves small group collaboration with groups working together on projects.  At the end of the course, each group presents their projects in the student presentation area.  Elaine's group uses the special discussion area that her instructor has set up for them, but they find they brainstorm and plan best in the live chat area, which is always available.  They also use the built-in email function to communicate and share.  One person in their group, Reggie, offers to create a Web page using the built-in home page templates for their final project presentation, and they are able to view and revise it together in the chat room as they develop the project.  They learn that other groups are creating their projects in PowerPoint and Adobe Acrobat, as well as Web pages.  All these projects will be shared during the final two weeks of the course. During that time, they will review all their peers' projects in the student presentation area and give them feedback using the rubric developed by their instructor. The final projects will be added to the STELLAR community library database so that they will continue to be accessible to everyone after the course is completed.  </FONT></TD>

Professional development courses on a variety of topics and content areas are available to members, and both professional development credits and units can be obtained.  Hosted live events are offered each month featuring reading scholars and other guest speakers who answer questions and discuss topics of interest with the community members.  Questions are submitted ahead of time and the events are well attended.</FONT></TD>
