<TITLE>A middle school life science teacher, Terry, wishes to conduct a project with a science class that involves students collectin</TITLE>

<P>Problem Scenario</P>
</B><P>Garin, a Biology teacher in Giles High School, has been taking his students to a local stream to monitor the invertebrate populations and local aquatic species found.  They have gathered stream biology data according to scientific protocols for the entire school-year.  They have compiled the population statistics into tables and charts and have related this data to what is known about how certain animals differentially tolerate pollutants.  The students have taken photos of the area.  They have also compiled photos of the aquatic life and descriptions and taxonomy describing them. </P>

<P>Jody, a Chemistry teacher at Blacksburg High School in the neighboring county, has been taking students to measure pH, nitrate, and phosphate levels in a nearby part of the same stream.  They have studied the chemistry involved in fertilizers, pesticides, and detergents used by local farmers and citizens.  They have plotted nearby locations of fields, neighborhoods, landfills, dumps, and the chemicals likely to have been deposited at these locations.  They have also collected photos and descriptions of chemical samples and illustrated chemical diagrams of these substances and their reactions in ground water.  </P>

<P>In yet another nearby section of the stream, Terry, a Life Science teacher at Christiansburg Middle School, has begun to interest her students in how the surrounding environment determines the health of the stream and river associated with the watershed and why people worry so much about distant places where wastes are released into the environment.  She knows little about the pollutants, chemistry and invertebrates, and she knows nothing about the studies being managed by her colleagues.  She does, however, have a strong desire to help her students understand the stream and enliven the curriculum she teaches.  </P>

<B><P>Envisionment scenario</P>
</B><P>Terry, a middle school Life Science teacher, is interested in helping her students understand the environmental health of the stream that passes near their school.  She opens a web browser and logs on to MOOsburg and sees that there are several water-quality data objects placed on the stream on the map in MOOsburg.  When she opens one of the objects, she notices that it contains links and annotations from other teachers using the MOOsburg tool for their fieldwork.  </P>

<P>Terry then clicks on the link to the other sites that are doing this work and discovers that teachers have water-quality projects ongoing in their classrooms.  Terry notices that other students have discussed their collection procedures, their results, relevant scientific principles and processes, and their conclusions regarding environmental impact.  </P>

<P>While Terry is interested in general environmental issues suitable to middle schoolers, other teachers have focused on more advanced and esoteric topics.  For example, she notes that the data tool links to an object created by a high school chemistry teacher, Jody, working on water chemistry in the streams, and it also links to an object created by a high school biology teacher, Garin, studying ecology of aquatic life in the streams.  Terry finds these and projects very useful perspectives since they provide nice examples of the interdisciplinarity of science involved in the study of stream environments; however, some of the material is too advanced for middle school students.  Since the objects provide links to the other teachers, she sends email to them to ask about their projects.  In discussing the issues with the biology and chemistry teacher, they decide to let the science supervisor know about their conversations and projects.  </P>

<P>The supervisor and superintendent have been supporting specific curricular connections related to scientific process skills, for example those dealing with developing field data-gathering and analysis skills, since these reoccur in subsequent grade levels and subject areas.  The supervisor has been working on a concept-map describing relations among these skills.  This concept-map has been imported into MOOsburg as a shared object that allows different users to edit, append, and configure the representation according to particular SOLs and objectives.  In using this model, teachers and supervisors co-developed a way (language) to address, represent, and evaluate the local needs and interpretations of science process and inquiry skills across subject level.</P>

<P>As a result of the conversations, rather than having her students simply redo the projects used by these high school science students, Terry has her students compile some of the results and analyses of the other groups into an online presentation for the local community.  This requires distilling and representing data and results from other projects, so Terry decides that her students need to contact the other students and their teachers to help understand what was done and what it meant.  This was easy to do since the links were readily available, and the students were not only able to email questions, but actually use the chat feature, shared data, shared notebook tools, and audio conference to communicate and share information with the older students.  The chemistry teacher found that this was an excellent opportunity for his students to reflect on their lab work since the students were not only excited about sharing their work with other students and the community but also since it required them to explain the work very clearly and simply to the younger students.  This tutoring, which took place entirely using MOOsburg tools, reinforced their understanding of the project and also gave the chemistry students confidence in their own ability to learn and explain the science.  The chemistry teacher, along with the students, designed short activities using the MOOsburg tools that helped his students organize their tutoring and present their stream chemistry work using pictures from the field work, abbreviated data charts, graphs, chemical diagrams, other online sources, SOL objectives, and short lessons and mini-labs that built on each other.  Ultimately, many of the sources became reused in the presentation compiled by the middle school students that could be accessed by their parents, judges of the science fair, and the larger community.</P>

<P>One day, when Terry had the steam-data object opened, an avatar appeared in the object that indicated another user was accessing a similar data object.  Terry typed into the chat associated with the object, &quot;hello.&quot;  The other person responded, &quot;Hi, you must be doing a similar project.  I am a teacher at Eastern Middle School.&quot;  The conversation continued as the two teachers discussed their curriculum, classroom goals, and problems.  They met periodically in MOOsburg to share data, teaching ideas, and materials.  Terry was able to walk the other middle school teacher through the various activities that had worked well with her students.  She took the other teacher through the chemistry tutoring exercise as a model example, and then warned the teacher about the aquatic biology activity that had not gone as well and needed work to make more engaging and more suitable to middle schoolers.  </P>

<P>The new teacher responded in the next month by having her students adapt and develop a game in MOOsburg that had worked well in the past in her classroom.  The game was related to local fishing.  Adapting the game simply required the students and teacher to scan some pictures and descriptions of native fish and place them in local streams and ponds where they lived.  Then students input the rules of the game so that others could play it online.  The high school biology students found the game and added some more advanced ecology rules to it, noting that certain fish like insects that are either tolerant or intolerant to pollutants found in particular local waters, information found from their own data gathering.  The game evolved and was further adapted to be played synchronously with students across the area.  Because the game was dispersed throughout MOOsburg, and the stream-data tools were also found in various location, and because these tools were also interconnected, other students and teachers interested in the local watershed found the tools and were thereby directed to the various related sources.</P>
