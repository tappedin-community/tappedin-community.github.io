<P>Kari&#146;s Scenario</P>

<P>Background: MargeS</P>

<P>MargeS has been teaching 9th grade science for 15 years now.  Marge just became a member of TAPPED IN today and logged in for the first time.  She heard about TAPPED IN through another teacher at her school and decided to check it out.  She loves teaching science and wants to learn how she can integrate technology into her lessons.  She is &quot;comfortable&quot; using her computer for email, word processing, spreadsheets, and using the internet.  Her son uses ICQ and AOL&#146;s IM and she has watched him use it, but she has never communicated in a live environment via the web before.  Curious and a bit nervous feeling that this will all be over her head, she bravely logs into TAPPED IN to see what it has to offer.</P>

<P>Time Period: An afternoon</P>

<P>Marge decides to fill out the membership form in advance at her friend&#146;s suggestion. She receives her membership info and proceeds to log in.  Not quite sure what to do, Marge sees the words, &quot;Hi Marge, welcome to TAPPED IN&quot; scroll onto her screen.  &quot;This is a good start&quot; Marge says to herself.  She types in &quot;hi&quot; and sends off her first live message.  </P>

<P>So begins a friendly conversation between herself and the helpdesk volunteer who so kindly greeted her.  The helpdesk volunteer explains what TAPPED IN is and shows her a web page of the types of things she can do her.  A bit overwhelmed by everything, Marge begins to ask a few questions.  &quot;Do you have anything for science teachers?&quot; she asks.  The helpdesk volunteer eagerly points out the After School Online Calendar of Events.  Marge is excited to learn that there is a discussion targeted just for science teachers!  The helpdesk volunteer explains how she can participate in the next discussion. </P>

<P>&quot;So is TAPPED IN basically just for these discussions?&quot; asks Marge.  The helpdesk volunteer smiles and explains that there are many things to discover at TAPPED IN.  The volunteer explains how TAPPED IN has partner organizations that provide various resources to guests and members.  The volunteer explains that Marge might be particularly interested in seeing the PALS suite on the 2nd floor which provides resources for performance assessment in science, as well as the Lawrence Hall of Science suite.  More curious even still, Marge asks to see these suites.  The helpdesk shows Marge how to navigate her way around TAPPED IN by pointing and clicking.  They find their way to the 2nd floor suites and begin to explore and exchange more questions and answers.  Marge is pleased to find the resources available.  </P>

<P>&quot;But there is more&quot; says the helpdesk volunteer.  At this point, Marge is very intrigued and her head is beginning to spin with the newness of it all.  The volunteer explains how Marge can have her own private office at TAPPED IN where she can meet online with her colleagues and/or students.  They visit a sample office and Marge is thrilled with the possibilities.  She could even bring her students online to TAPPED IN to do projects.</P>

<P>This thought brings her back to her original goal: to learn how she can effectively integrate technology into her science classroom.  The volunteer recommends that she check out the Tech in the Classroom discussion as well as the mail list TAPPED IN maintains for that discussion group.  Marge is very excited about that idea.  She glances at the clock and realizes how fast the time has flown and that she must be going.  She promises to return for a Tips and Tours and plans to attend the upcoming discussions and maybe even get her own office.  She can&#146;t wait to tell her friends about this wonderful place!</P>
