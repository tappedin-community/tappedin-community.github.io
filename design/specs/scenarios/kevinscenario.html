<P>Marta, Filiberto, Maria Elena and Luz are members of Telementor Team A and are working together on their community learning projects.  They are also preparing to be mentors to others in their school community and at the College of Education where Marta teaches.  Marta is a teacher education faculty member with a specialty in critical pedagogy.  Filiberto is a bilingual 5<SUP>th</SUP> grade teacher and Maria Elena and Luz are parents with children in Filiberto&#146;s class and younger children in the same school.  They are all participants in the Center for Language Minority Education and Research (CLMER) Telementor Cadre.  There are 20 telementors in this cadre, including these four members of Team A.</P>

<B><P>What</P>
</B>
<P>The CLMER Telementor Cadre meets face-to-face for about 8 or 9 days over a 9 to 10 month period, two or three days at a time, with additional team work and activities between sessions.  In addition, members of the group engage in readings in-between f2f sessions, collaborate on projects both during and in-between f2f sessions and engage in online communication minimally via listserv(s), a web-based threaded discussion board and chat, but sometimes also experimenting with and/or adopting other ways to collaborate and communicate via computers and telecommunications.  They also look for meaningful uses of information and communication technologies in their learning projects.  CLMER Telementoring makes use of six &quot;lenses&quot; that are the focus of dialogue, individual and group participation, learning projects and mentoring activities; these lenses are: (1) Language issues and language learning in schools, communities and society; (2) Critical Pedagogy; (3) Anti-Racist Education; (4) Standards; (5) Community Learning Theory (a mix of cross-cultural adult learning, community organizing and school-home-community collaboration approaches) and (6) Technology Fluency.  The goals are to create community-connected learning that integrates these lenses, to develop a learning community among participants and to develop approaches for ongoing learning and mentoring of others.</P>

<P>CLMER staff members facilitate and participate in the CLMER Telementor Cadre learning community and often follow-up with e-mail, phone support and site visitations between f2f meetings; they are also always looking for creative ways to support cadre members, including via other technologies.  Telementors are expected to participate in all face-to-face meetings and activities between meetings.   Telementors have received a laptop for their participation and by the end of the 10 months will have developed some kind of a learning project, as a member of a small team (of 2 or more telementors, just like Team A).  Learning projects can be as large as the creation of an after school Community Learning and Technology Center and as small as an individual classroom learning activity, with most being project-based learning projects.  Further, each telementor is responsible for at least six days of mentoring activity which they may accomplish through a variety of strategies &#151; f2f mentoring, online mentoring, phone support, development of multimedia to mediate a mentoring activity, etc.</P>

<B><P>Participation</P>
</B>
<P>Team A started with their telementor cadre about three months ago.  The first two-day meeting included a lot of time for &quot;Conocimiento,&quot; time for sharing and dialogue including the sharing of personal background and life experiences.  The dialogue took place in Spanish, English and Khmer, sometimes with simultaneous translation in front of the full group, other times with members of the cadre sitting near each other in language-alike groups to make sure everyone was able to participate in the language most comfortable to them, with personal translation as needed.  Shared information was not merely translated, rather time was provided for small group processing of information and small group conversation around themes of the full group dialogue.  In this and subsequent meetings, highlights of group activities and dialogue also become part of an electronic group memory, generated during the f2f time together and/or developed/summarized/designed afterwards by volunteers from among staff and participants.  The volunteers make these highlights available electronically, but also try to create some interactivity that will facilitate follow-up on important dialogues or activities, either asynchronously, synchronously online or via future f2f meetings.</P>

<P>At the first two-day meeting, as part of the Conocimiento participants shared stories and developed artwork in a variety of media &#151; watercolor, pastels, clay, fingerpaints and origami.  The artwork complemented the stories and group dialogues and some of the artwork was designed as metaphors for what the cadre members want to accomplish in their work together (metaphors they negotiate and design together).  Participants and CLMER staff took digital photos of the art as well as photos of much of the group activity, and some audio and video clips of participants.  These photos and clips were then made available as thumbnail photos and links on a web page for participants to use as raw material for stories and multimedia presentations while learning new technologies.   Small groups of 4 or 5 laptops were arranged in stations so that different telementors could gravitate to a station of their choice to learn different things, e.g., how to use Power Point in the context of their evolving and future learning projects, Photoshop for enhancing their multimedia storytelling, use of virtual worlds for online learning and collaboration, etc.</P>

<P>The focus &quot;lenses&quot; dialogues for these first two days were on the topics of critical pedagogy and community learning theory.  The group discussed messages that come from the media, from schools, from the community, from the home and from other sources that contribute either to a feeling of &quot;El Si&quot; (positive, affirming messages of learner and community strengths that create a sense of &quot;poder&quot; &#151; power, to be able to) or conversely a feeling of &quot;El No&quot; (denigrating or discounting messages that leave learners and community members feeling that they are not able, cannot participate, or are in some way deficient or undeserving).  Parents, teachers and faculty discuss how these messages of &quot;El Si&quot; and &quot;El No&quot; play out in subtle and overt ways in the community, at school, at home and in the university.  </P>

<P>They also discuss ways to create a more level playing field among different participants &#151; diverse students, parents, teachers, administrators, faculty and community members.  Importantly they engage in discussion, planning and design around what their learning projects can do to address this, while also addressing the other lenses such as high standards for content, primary language and English language development, etc. (though these other lenses will be taken up in more detail in future sessions and through interim online and offline activities between meetings).  Between the first meeting and the second meeting two months later everyone read a bilingual story by Alma Flor Ada that illustrated some of the issues discussed in the first meeting and that provided some ideas for family literacy activities.  Cadre members got online to discuss any implications they see for their learning projects of that story, or any of the things they learned from this first meeting that can contribute to their projects.  Some of the parents who wanted support getting online met together at the computer lab at the Boys and Girls club and did their posting from there while they were together as a group.</P>

<B><P>Learning Projects</P>
</B>
<P>Team A (Marta, Filiberto, Maria Elena and Luz) are planning together how they can integrate the concepts of &quot;El Si&quot; and &quot;El No&quot; into a Learning Network project that Filiberto&#146;s class will be participating in called &quot;Connecting Math to Our Lives.&quot;  They are partnering with Sophal&#146;s class that is predominantly made up of Cambodian students.  They want the students to get some exposure to each others&#146; languages as well as to collect some oral stories from parents and community members about math in their lives.  They&#146;d like to have ways to share the Khmer language characters online, alongside of the Spanish and English quick writes and poems that the students will be doing on the math theme.  Also, Filiberto&#146;s class wants to do research in the library, to calculate the percentage of books that have positive &quot;El Si&quot; images of people who use math professionally and are also Latino or Cambodian.  The two classes will examine the books for these and for some other factors, like the gender and ethnicity of authors, whether authors are alive or dead, etc., and create bar graphs and other graphical representations of their findings.  </P>

<P>Marta is going to arrange some math mentors from among faculty member friends who are Latino as well, who are going to e-mail the students about what they do for a living and what they needed to learn themselves, in elementary school and through college in order to do the work they&#146;re doing.  They&#146;ll also share stories of how they came to be interested in math and what it was like for them to become mathematicians in their families.  Team A plans ways to use videoconferencing, audio and multimedia as another way to capture these stories and exchanges with the learners in the two participating classrooms.  They also talk about using OneBox online voice mail to gather some interviews from mathematicians in other countries.  And Filiberto is starting to experiment with Palm Pilots with his students and the parents to capture community information in spreadsheets and text to be brought in and synched into a common database as part of a collective portrait of the community.  One thing they want to do is to collect data about whom in their community has computers and Internet connections, to find out how they use their computers (and how many do, if they have them) and to compare this to some national data about computer and Internet use.</P>

<B><P>Supporting Technologies</P>
</B>
<P>CLMER Telementors are always looking for a variety of technologies to support their work together as a community, to support their team learning projects and to support their mentoring activities.  To be useful, online collaboration spaces should be inviting to faculty members, teachers and parents alike (in terms of the adult participants, and affordances for student participation would be a great bonus).  The metaphor of a &quot;campus&quot; with buildings and offices may not be the best for this mix of adults.  The ability for a group to create its own metaphors would be good; otherwise a more community-centric rather than institution-centric metaphor may be appropriate.  Multimedia publishing possibilities are important, not only for accomplishing multiple types of tasks, but sometimes for ensuring full participation.  Participants whose keyboard skills may be weaker can still, for instance, leave asynchronous online voice mail messages.  Accommodations for diverse languages would be key, e.g., robust use of the UNICODE Standard, with affordances for non-roman character sets, e.g., Khmer, Vietnamese, Chinese.  Places to archive photos, video clips and audio clips would be helpful, perhaps via some peer-to-peer technology, so that no central server carries the full storage burden, but so that swapping resources is easy (an Instant Messaging system can help with this as well).  </P>

<P>&quot;Publishing,&quot; of whatever variety may be available in this online environment, should be easy to do for diverse types of adult participants (with perhaps some instructions in languages other than English when needed).  Places to showcase learning projects and/or to post them online as part of a portfolio in order to get constructive feedback in their design would be helpful.  Connections to other learning communities and in general to a wider community would be exciting, especially if the group would also feel welcome in terms of being able to find online &quot;workshops&quot; or content on topics that reflect the telementor &quot;lenses,&quot; as well as other topics besides the lenses (and an ability to offer dialogue and online &quot;workshops&quot; for others).  A place for parents to find other parents and for teachers from, say, Two-Way Bilingual Immersion programs to find other teachers and develop opportunities for communication and collaboration would be well-received by CLMER Telementors.</P></BODY>
