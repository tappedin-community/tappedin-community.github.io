<FONT FACE="Times New Roman,Times" SIZE=2><P>Neika Is a 3<SUP>rd</SUP> grade teacher who has been teaching for 4 years and finally feels like she knows what she&#146;s doing. She has a computer at home and uses it to check email and prepare materials for her lessons. But she is not that comfortable installing new software and downloading plug-ins.  She learned about TAPPED IN when she heard Mark Schlaeger give a powerful speech at a CUE conference.  She went home and after overcoming much difficulty getting started, she signed up and set up a virtual office with high hopes of creating online conversations with colleagues and experts. Unfortunately she found it difficult to get others to go online. This year her school has chosen to focus on literacy and Neika is working with her grade level teachers on building a balanced literacy program with an emphasis on reading comprehension to address the needs of her struggling students. Neika has recently joined the BASRC Literacy Learning Community to get together with others and expand her knowledge of the learning and teaching of reading. She hopes to gain new strategies and build skills on doing diagnostic assessments.</FONT></TD>

<FONT FACE="Times New Roman,Times" SIZE=2><P>Neika&#146;s Literacy Learning Community is using TAPPEDIN as their collaborative work environment. Neika has a three  focal students she is following in her classroom. She has encountered a particular challenge with the low reader in teaching phonemic awareness. She has tried two techniques unsuccessfully and goes online to ask a question and discuss her situation. Neika first posts a question into the shared knowledge base (an AskMe like environment where people ask questions which are answered by others in the community who are experienced in the topic area.) She then schedules a gathering to discuss &quot;teaching and assessing reading for low achieving students in 3<SUP>rd</SUP> grade&quot;. Finally she goes into the online caf&eacute; and discusses her situation with whoever is around. A colleague tells her of some materials he&#146;d heard were great but he doesn&#146;t know where to find them. Neika sends a note to the listserve asking if anyone knows more about the materials or how to get them.</P>
<P>&nbsp;</P>
<P>When Neika&#146;s group meets online they discuss techniques for working with Neika&#146;s low reader but soon get into data and assessment. Mark takes them on a tour of web pages where students can play simple games and answer questions and the teacher can get an initial assessment in a few specific areas. He also shows tools so that the teacher can create her own assessments online. The tools show the teacher graphs of her class&#146;s abilities which she can share and discuss with others in the Literacy Learning Community. Ultimately Neika would like to collect assessment data on her Palm Pilot, download it into a system, look at progress over time and be able to share the results with her colleagues on TAPPED IN.</FONT></TD>

<FONT FACE="Times New Roman,Times" SIZE=2><P>Over the course of the year Neika stores her notes, articles, data and assessments  in her office. She also has quicktime movies showing a lesson in each class of members on her grade level team.  Using the Cycle of Inquiry she constantly revisits these materials, discusses them with colleagues and readjusts her practice to improve on areas that are not working, take advantage of successes and to focus on the evolving grade level goals. During the year she and the other 3<SUP>rd</SUP> grade teachers see trends in the data that enable them to identify holes in the students abilities from 2<SUP>nd</SUP> grade. She discusses these with the 2<SUP>nd</SUP> grade team so they can consider adjusting their curriculum as well.</FONT></TD>

While she has little experience she feels that she knows the tools she will use to turn the school into a learning community that uses the data, assessment and the Cycle of Inquiry to improve learning and teaching at her new school. She feels her office and the tools at TAPPED IN will be the key to success of her new career. </P>
