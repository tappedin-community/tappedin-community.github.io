<FONT FACE="Times"><P>As an EE, Amy received a great deal of face-to-face training with a consultant from AEL, one of the ten regional educational laboratories.  She participated in a weeklong retreat at the beginning of her term where she met other EEs and participated in community-building activities.  One session at the retreat focused on using technology to sustain the community of EEs.  A listserv was created (hosted by AEL), and Amy received training on the use of listservs.  Because she was familiar with them, she has no problems using it.  It has allowed for a greater sense of community and has increased communication among the EEs.  In the beginning, the discussions were seeded by the consultant at AEL.  However, within a few short weeks EEs began and sustained their own conversations about problems, concerns, successes, and lessons learned.</FONT></TD>

<FONT FACE="Times"><P>Once the work began in the schools, the consultant introduced a Web-based journaling component.  Amy received instruction before she was expected to use the technology.  She enters a password-protected site, selects her name from a drop-down menu, and opens her personal journal.  There, she keys in what she is doing in her two schools.  She makes daily or weekly entries, depending on how much time she has available.   A template guides her to address specific details, including her activities, the people she is working with, and information about what is working and what isn&#146;t working.  The research staff at AEL uses this data to assist in the program evaluation.</FONT></TD>

<FONT FACE="Times"><P>Amy has positioned herself to be a leader in the EE program.  She makes herself available for phone calls, emails, listserv discussions, and face-to-face meetings with other EEs as well as consultants.
