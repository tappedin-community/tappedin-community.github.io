<FONT FACE="Times"><P>Amy, a recently retired teacher, was selected to serve as an Exemplary Educator (EE) in Tennessee for 2 years.  She is one of 41 selected to provide additional support to the schools in greatest need of improved student achievement.  The primary focus is on improved teaching and learning. Amy has extensive experience with e-mail and Web use from her last ten years of teaching and has continued using her home computer daily. She has used simple videoconferencing tools, such as NetMeeting, and feels lost without her wireless PDA. She uses it to coordinate her calendar with her task list and contacts. She doesn&#146;t use the small screen much for surfing the Web, but has found it useful for many things she never once thought about, such as checking restaurants for reservations, booking hotel rooms, and catching up on news stories. </P>

<FONT FACE="Times"><P>At the beginning of the program, Amy attended a two-day workshop focused on the philosophy of the program, key strategies for working in online communities, and some hands-on training with some of the Web-based tools, such as videoconferencing, shared workspaces, and the customizable interface. Further training and examples of software use are available as multimedia files online and contain helpful step-by-step graphics, audio files, and some animations. Because the interface is customizable and scalable, Amy has been able to organize her desktop when logged on to provide her with only the information she feels is most pertinent. She has input key words on topics of interest and the system notifies her of new or changing information in the system. She felt overwhelmed at first with reading and keeping up with the listservs, but the search and remind feature provides her with a &quot;digest&quot; that she feels is easier to manage.</P>

<FONT FACE="Times"><P>AEL provides monthly WebCasts featuring specialists in areas identified in listserv, phone, and face-to-face conversations as well as videoconferences from intensive site schools. If Amy misses a videoconference, they are archived and an auto-reminder notifies her of the possible viewing. Although she&#146;s become quite adept at typing, Amy much prefers a (broadband) videoconference where she can just speak and not worry about trying to read and respond so quickly through the keyboard. Amy schedules a conference with her assigned school principals at least once a week. She knows Robert at Spring Hill enjoys a videoconference while the others are more comfortable with a phone call or chatting online. Regardless, they have all found working through forms online helpful. She wishes she had the lesson plan database, student tracking software, </P>
<P>and the templates for other common school management activities now available when she was teaching.</FONT></TD>

<FONT FACE="Times"><P>After phone calls, videoconferences, or help sessions, Amy can quickly record contact data on her PDA and uploads this data to the information system via the Web at a later date. The system knows who she is and easily allows her to enter shared workspaces with appropriate cohorts, where they can create and edit documents or collaborate online. She knows she can share graphics and other media files, as well, but has done little of that beyond a few graphs in her own group. Her group did once include a visually-impaired teacher who used a microphone and voice-recognition software to collaborate. It was four months before Amy realized her colleague wasn&#146;t typing!</FONT></TD>

<FONT FACE="Times"><P>The key to Amy&#146;s success is using technology to organize her work so that she is not overwhelmed. Communication was never a problem when she was teaching. She was fond of talking in the teacher&#146;s lounge and found early chat rooms, e-mail, and listservs engrossing. The problem was that they were often too engrossing. The seamless technologies she uses now that can monitor each other and fade into the background have given her more time to focus on establishing key relationships and pursuing her passions outside of her work. </FONT></TD>
