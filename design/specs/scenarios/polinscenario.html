<P>CarlosV and RoryC &#151; teachers, grad. Students</P>

<P>CarlosV hurries home from elementary school where he teaches 5<SUP>th</SUP> grade. Tonight, in his online grad. class he will present a brief video clip he shot in class last week. CarlosV has edited the longer tape into a three minute QuickTime movie of classroom small group work, which he submitted to his instructor. Tonight in Tapped In Carlos will lead his class in discussion of the clip, which his teacher has uploaded to the TI server, and which will be available to the class in a video window in their TI theatre. He is hoping to get some feedback on the clip as part of a case study he is developing, and which he hopes will be accepted in the Tapped In Case Library. Like his classmates, Carlos has password access to the library of cases to which many teachers, staff developers, researchers, administrators, and vendors have been contributing, using a template developed by the TI Case Group.</P>
<P>Later that evening, RoryC and her classmates are deeply engaged in a discussion of CarlosV&#146;s video clip. The discussion heads off onto a debate about portfolios for assessing students. RoryC wants to return to this section of the discussion later, and so uses the MARK command to insert a labeled tag into the transcript to make it easier to find this spot later when she opens the transcript in her word processor. She labels the tag PORTFOLIOS. Fortunately , this option has not taken much time or space in her display window and she doesn&#146;t lose a beat in the conversation.</P>
<P>Though separated by 1200 miles, Carlos and RoryC have had their 5<SUP>th</SUP> grade classrooms interacting about space exploration, specifically, the kids have been writing a collaborative white paper outlining NASA priorities for the next five years. Carlos and Rory think they want to try to find some grant money to support the expansion of this activity, perhaps even involving NASA/JPL. After online class ends, they both jump over to the Partnership Center to paw through the database of grants and contracts, and TI resident expertise, while exchanging remarks on the telephone. RoryC spots an upcoming Saturday online seminar on project budgeting tips for proposal writers, and they agree she will check into it. She investigates the seminar on its homepage and learns that the instructor, another TI resident, has led this seminar four time previously. The attached feedback from attendees suggests that it will be a valuable session for Rory and Carlos. She fills in the online form requesting a spot in the next seminar. Carlos notes the NASA/JPL office in TI and the names of the NASA TI residents, and sends a sticky note to his own TI office about contacting them.</P>
<P>While they are looking in the TI database and chatting on the phone, CarlosV receives an announcement in his TI window that the Rouge Forum meeting on high stakes testing is scheduled for next Tuesday at 8 pm Pacific. There will be a special guest online. He &#145;accepts&#146; the message and chooses to have it recorded on his TI calendar. RoryC does not receive this message because she has not added the Rouge Forum on her membership profile.</P>
<P>RoryC logs out to deal with her kids, and Carlos decides he has a bit of time available to go search the TI library. He wants to download the PDF document his instructor referred to in class, and look for related items. When he enters the library area to search, he need not present any password. His membership flag is already set, giving him access to several areas of material. He really only has time to grab the PDF document and save the search. Because he knows RoryC shares his interests, he decides to give her access to the saved search results. Maybe she could refine the search and re-save it for him when she&#146;s in next. He fires off a Quicknote to her about it.</P>
<P>Later that night, around 11 pm, RoryC logs back in. She&#146;s not really focused on work, just trolling for interaction. There&#146;s a group hanging out in the BookMark, a book club discussion spot, and a smaller group in the woods, doing Lord knows what. She doesn&#146;t recognize any names in either group; besides she&#146;s not in the mood for chat. She checks out the policy discussion board and finds herself sucked in to a threaded discussion on &#145;high stakes testing.&#146; There are even postings by Carlos there! She notices remarks about the Rouge Forum and opens up a brief description of the group with a link to their TI offices. She pops over and noses around in the resources there. She decides it looks interesting and sets her membership profile to accept messages/announcements from them. Almost immediately she gets a note announcing the upcoming Special Guest session with Susan Ohanian that will be held in the TI Civic Auditorium next week. She forwards the note to her TI calendar, which she has set to send her email reminders on a weekly basis. Back in her own office she finds CarlosV&#146;s note about the search on the door, but she&#146;s tired so she resets it to &#145;unread.&#146;</P>
<P>Before logging out RoryC checks her TI credits. Over the past six months she has introduced 7 new teachers to Tapped In, and all seven have formally joined. She looks at the 21 credit points and considers using them to purchase new memory/storage space for the bookshelf in her TI office. She definitely needs to better organize that mess. She ponders using the credits to upgrade her library access privileges, or to buy a seat in that budgeting seminar. She likes it that the effort she puts into the TI community is recognized, and that she receives the coin of the realm for her work. </P>
