<P>Carmen , an online instructor, is getting her courseroom ready for the second meeting of her class on school reform.  She finds holding class in these specially designed courserooms is much more productive than meeting in her office as it is a shared space belonging to everyone in the course and designed for their group interactions.</P>

<P>She begins by adding some files to the shared workspace.  There will be a number of collaborative projects and she is listing the procedures, adding the rubrics and links to examples of how other students have completed the tasks.  She notes that a few of the students have started to describe their projects.  She reads their work and leaves some encouraging feedback for the students. One of the projects involves building a library on school reform.  The library is an ongoing project from previous years.  They students are collecting a set of examples of schools that have detailed their reform changes and indicated the outcomes.  They are annotating these examples. She looks and sees that the library is growing.  She examines some of the new links. </P>

<P>The TAPPED IN classroom is the focal point of the course. It contains links to the syllabus and other course information. She lists the times she will be available for office hours this week, encouraging students to drop by her office for more informal interactions. The times for the next session in TAPPED IN are listed with a link to a class agenda. She adds the transcript of the last class meetings to the file cabinet so that student can refer back to earlier meetings. The file cabinet is only open to class members as Carmen thinks it is important to have some space where conversations are private and not available to those who are not in the class.</P>

<P>She opens the class meeting agenda. Students can add things to the course meeting agenda so that they can help direct the flow of interaction.  She checks and finds that one student wants to know more about the background and context for the writing of A Nation at Risk.  She emails the note to herself as a reminder to prepare some notes for this purpose.  She adds some discussion questions from the readings that she would like students to think about.  She adds a note encouraging students to add their ideas and emails the changes to the class list as a reminder. </P>

<P>Some students are already in the course room working on the reform library when Carmen arrives for the third class meeting.  She is pleased to see students are early for class. She welcomes them and asks them how their week has gone.  As students start to arrive she checks to see who is here.  Like in other rooms, there is a listing of who is here, but a special feature of classrooms is that she can also see who is missing. As she is getting ready to start, she types  &quot;/role call&quot;  and the list of students present is added to the transcript with a time stamp.  Some time later when another student arrives, she types &quot;/timestamp.  She can search the transcript on timestamps to find any student that joined the class while it was in session.  Sometimes she types &quot;/roll call again at the end of class to record the ending time and participants.   </P>

<P>Students have assigned colors which helps her to learn to recognize their contributions.  She finds the combination of name and color works well in helping her gain a strong sense of her students. She knows immediately who is talking and can see how many people are actively contributing to the discussion. </P>

<P>The discussion is underway. Carmen highlights a student question and partial discussion and moves it to the discussion forum for asynchronous interaction. Carmen has more to say on this topic but it would take too long to write it.  She will return later when the students are gone and add more details and links to specific papers.  During a course meeting she generally opens 3 or 4 discussions and the students can chose the one they want to participate in during the week. </P>

<P>She ends class by reminding students of the readings and the work for the week. Some students click the readings list and send it to their email. Carmen reminds them to leave links to their web assignments in the course work folder.  </P>

<P>Later when the students have left, Carmen spends time exploring the new features in tapped in thinking about how they can be used to help organize both teaching and learning.  She sees that they are adding a new feature&#150;student exhibitions for featuring student work. While this container is somewhat similar to the library, the layout is different.  Multiple listings by title, student name and website with one sentence descriptions make it easy to see student work.  They can be rearranged by student, topic, or date.</P>

<P>The other feature that Carmen had asked for has also been implemented.  The showing of &quot;objects&quot; is arranged first by rooms and then by containers in that room.  This makes it easier for her to find the file cabinets that are not located in a room and have materials from past courses.  She retrieves a note that she used in a previous class, edits it and inserts it in the discussion forum for this week.  She find that by reusing notes she can tailor them to the specific needs of this class but does not have to work from the beginning each time.  The ability to have materials not located in any room turns out to be a real asset. </P>

<P>The last thing Carmen does before she leaves is visit the demonstration courseroom.  This is where any new features are described.  She notes the time of the tapped in demo of exhibitions.  She also looks to see if there are any notices on the whiteboard.  Other faculty leave their wish lists on the whiteboard and then the tapped in staff see if they can come up with a way of implementing the change.  That is how the roll call feature, the timestamp and the assigned colors to student's talk features were added to the courserooms. She looks over the ways that features are used in this instructor&#146;s courseroom and sees some ideas that she might incorporate in the school reform courseroom.  She also leaves a quick note of appreciation for the new listing of objects.  It is going to save her so much time.  She also sees that three new instructors have joined.  She lists her name as a mentor volunteer if they need any help in setting up their new courseroom. Carmen logs off and goes downstairs to make dinner. </P></FONT>
