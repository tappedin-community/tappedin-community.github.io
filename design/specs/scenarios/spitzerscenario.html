<P>TAPPED IN User Scenario</P>

<P>New England Aquarium</P>
<P>July 2001</P>

<P>I am envisioning a typical user as, for example, a Boston elementary school who has some experience teaching, some interest in teaching more about science and the environment, but not much background in science or experience with hands-on science teaching or learning. This teacher (&quot;Shelly&quot;) has not had a lot of experience with technology, beyond basic use of email and the web. </P>

<P>Shelly has been to the New England Aquarium, taken her students on field trips here, and borrowed whale and penguin kits from the Aquarium&#146;s Teacher Resource Center (TRC). In January, she attended a week-long professional development program at the Aquarium where she learned about the Aquarium&#146;s resources, met new colleagues, gone on local environmental field trips, and learned about some new ways to incorporate science into teaching literacy&#150;one of the major priorities in her school is helping inner city students learn to read and write. </TD>
<TD WIDTH="33%" VALIGN="TOP">
<P>Background: Main actor, Shelly, her occupation, background</P>

<P>Context: Alumnus of a professional development program</P>
<P>Time period: 6 months</TD>
</TR>
<TR><TD WIDTH="67%" VALIGN="TOP">
<P>While at the Aquarium, she learned about the &quot;Tapped In Aquarium&quot; &#151; a new way to &quot;connect&quot; to the museum and its staff even when it&#146;s closed. She created her own &quot;office&quot; where she can bookmark materials from the TRC, web links, etc.</TD>
<TD WIDTH="33%" VALIGN="TOP">
<P>Feature: Virtual office, as a personal organizer for information, can keep the office long term</TD>

<TR><TD WIDTH="67%" VALIGN="TOP">
<P>It is now April, several months since she has been to the Aquarium. Shelly is interested in planning a field trip for her class to a local salt marsh, but can&#146;t remember some of the details she learned during the workshop.</P>

<P>Shelly has a few spare minutes on evening after reading student homework, fires up her computer and modem, and connects to the Aquarium&#146;s website. She then opts to connect to the &quot;Virtual Aquarium&quot; and then, by navigating a map, decides to visit the Teacher Resource Center (TRC).</TD>

<P>Feature: Map of the Aquarium reflects the physical layout, can visit offices, behind the scenes areas, as well as exhibits</TD>

<P>In this &quot;room&quot; there are many objects &#151; books, curriculum binders, biofacts (like whale bones, otter fur, etc.), kits, videos, etc. &#151; just like in the real TRC. By clicking on one of them, she can find out more information about the object. She can even arrange to borrow materials and have them sent to her school or home.</TD>
<TD WIDTH="33%" VALIGN="TOP">
<P>Feature: Database of objects</P>
<P>Activity: Can learn more about objects, check out real objects for borrowing</TD>
</TR>
<TR><TD WIDTH="67%" VALIGN="TOP">
<P>There is also a discussion room, in which several other teachers and a member of the TRC staff, Lynn, are discussing ways to teach literacy through science. Lynn introduces Shelly to the group, who are getting together for a biweekly online action research group. Several have posted examples of student work that they have scanned in, as well as digital photos of their classrooms in action.</TD>
<TD WIDTH="33%" VALIGN="TOP">
<P>Activities: synchronous discussions, asynchronous discussions</P>

<P>Features: Can post files in rooms, discussions, etc.</TD>

<P>She listens for a while, then goes to Sukey&#146;s office (she is the staff person who led the workshop on field trips), and leaves her a note asking for help in planning her field trip. While she is there, she downloads some new materials that Sukey has posted on salt marshes.</TD>
<TD WIDTH="33%" VALIGN="TOP">
<P>Activities: asynchronous communication, downloading materials</TD>

<P>Shelly then goes to visit the Aquarium&#146;s online version of its salt marsh exhibit to learn more about the animals and habitats she will be visiting locally. She clicks on the mummichog, and gets a description of its natural history. She then enters the aquarist&#146;s office, and reads about what these fish eat and what conditions they would need if she set up a tank to keep some after the field trip.</TD>
<TD WIDTH="33%" VALIGN="TOP">
<P>Feature: virtual exhibits, with active objects (animals, equipment), staff, etc.</TD>

<P>Several weeks later, Shelly leads a successful field trip (after having had an e-mail exchange with Sukey, and borrowing field microscopes and plankton nets from the TRC). She posts some digital photos in her office, and sends a note to Sukey inviting her to visit her office to see them.</TD>
