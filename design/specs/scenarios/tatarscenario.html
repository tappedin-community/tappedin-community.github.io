<P>Deb Tatar Tapped In Scenario</P>

<P>Anne</P>

<P>Hi, I am a sixth grade teacher from a middle school in Omaha, Nebraska.  I have a BA in psychology and got my teaching credential at the same time.  So, I graduated from college and started teaching.  I&#146;ve been teaching about 4 years, so I really know what I&#146;m doing now.  The first year was pretty hard---all my illusions about working with children were completely blown.  I had to really learn how to keep them in their seats.  I learned that if I give them an inch, that&#146;s the end.  Especially the boys.  There are things that are still frustrating, like if they would do their homework, we&#146;d be able to get through all the chapters.  You know, I send notes home to the parents, and nothing happens.  I don&#146;t know what those parents are thinking.  Like my folks would have never let me get away without doing my homework.  It never even would have occurred to me!  Anyway,</P>
<P>so after the first year I got married, and after the third year, Joey was born and I had the summer and fall off, which worked out pretty well, and then came back in the spring.  </P>

<P>Some of the other teachers have been talking about using technology to teach science, and they get a lot of attention for this.  I kind of think, frankly, that we&#146;d be better off focusing on the curriculum and not getting into all that fancy stuff---how&#146;s it going to help me get through the material?---but the principal has really been pushing it and points out that the school down the road is doing a better job meeting the inquiry standards and besides, we have all this equipment.  The other teacher, Lois, got comp time to prepare for a unit on finding your family roots, where the kids had to find out about where their ancestors had come from, and then they&#146;re supposed to do something about the plants and weather in one of the places and think about what life was like for their ancestors and make a report.</P>

<P>So I promised myself that over the summer I would find out how to use the Web, and I was chatting to Lois, and she mentioned that she had gotten some help from this web site on line, Tapped In, and she told me a little bit about it, and it turned out that I could take a course on curriculum development using the Web and get some continuing education credit for it, but I don&#146;t know about taking a course on-line, so she said you didn&#146;t have to sign up for a full course all at once, but you could just drop on some seminars and see how it was.  </P>

<P>Mostly in the summertime I&#146;m with my baby, but he&#146;s still taking two naps a day and it gets kind of boring being home all the time.  So finally last week I put him down and went to the Web site.  It&#146;s a good thing that all the forms and stuff at my college were online, otherwise I might not know how to go to a Web site and find things!</P>

<P>So, I got there and I didn&#146;t really understand like what I was seeing right away.  But I saw that text was scrolling by in part of the screen, and it said &quot;hi&quot; and &quot;Type in the window below and press return to talk.&quot;  So, I said &quot;hi&quot;, because I didn&#146;t know what else to say.   Like I kept thinking about Dorothy in Oz, and wanted to be very polite, but really I&#146;d fallen on the witch.  I mean it&#146;s a little horrifying to fall on the witch, even if she turns out to be a bad one, and then everyone thinks you&#146;re something you&#146;re not.  And I was watching the text go by and I noticed that there were names and they seemed to be talking, and then one of them---Kari or something I forget---said something with my name&#150;the one I&#146;d given when I logged in as a guest---asked if she could help me.  But I didn&#146;t know what she meant---like when you walk into one of those little stores and they ask right away if they can help you and you think &quot;oh I have to buy something if I go in here, so you look around politely and leave quickly.&quot;  So I was pausing and trying to think how to answer.  But then she said &quot;I&#146;m here to help people figure out how to use Tapped In,&quot; so I didn&#146;t know, like I wondered if she was a real person or maybe something like a machine and wondered what she could do&#133;.  But then she said &quot;I&#146;m a real person and my job is to help out!  You can type anything you would say to a person (well, anything professional)!&quot;  So I typed &quot;I&#146;m just here to find out about Tapped In.&quot; And I guess she saw that I didn&#146;t know what to ask, cause she said &quot;I can tell you about it a little bit, and on Sunday mornings at 10 we also have a tour that you could take.&quot;  Anyway, so she showed me a bit about the system---I didn&#146;t really get what she said about creating stuff like decorating offices (what does decorating do?)---but I saw the calendar and I asked which seminars I could go to just to check things out.  </P>

<P>I was disappointed because the only one that looked right for me, on Technology Development, was in the early evening, when Joey&#146;s usually cranky and dinner needs to be on the stove.  So I thought maybe I couldn&#146;t really do more, but I didn&#146;t want to say that because I didn&#146;t want to hurt her feelings.   But she said &quot;Another thing I do is help newcomers find people like them to talk with about Tapped In or about educational issues.  I wonder if it would be helpful to talk with another 6<SUP>th</SUP> grade teacher?&quot;  Just then the baby started crying, but I gave my email address to Kari and she sent me email later on following up and then I got to talk with Diane who is a volunteer who really spends a lot of time on the system.</P>

<P>Anyway, so today I finally went to a seminar, and it was pretty good, except for two things.  One problem was that sometimes people seemed to be talking and I couldn&#146;t tell whether one person really meant to contradict the other or whether they were saying kind of the same thing.  So I whispered to Kari who was there and asked her if she understood, and she said that sometimes it was hard to tell and that partly I would get used to it, but also that if I rolled my mouse over a piece of dialog, then the thing that was on the screen when the person started writing that dialog would go green, so you could see whether they had seen when they decided to say something.  That was cool, and I could see that five or six statements had come in between when one of the guys started typing and when he sent the message, so I could see that he wasn&#146;t commenting on what they had said.</P>

<P>Then, everyone there was talking as though like it was just so obvious that if you use technology and emphasize &quot;inquiry&quot; the kids will do really well.  But what I want to know is &quot;is it going to raise their scores?&quot;  How am I going to do that and get through their curriculum?&quot;  I didn&#146;t want to say anything but I wondered if there were teachers more like me.  Somebody else raised the question of scores, and there was a lot of back and forth that I didn&#146;t really understand, but some people didn&#146;t really think scores were important.  But I know they&#146;re important.  I was just about to leave, but then the leader said &quot;You know, this question about scores is really important, because for a lot of teacher, especially new teachers, scores are how they&#146;re being judged and how they judge themselves.  I think we need to get back to inquiry here, but I&#146;m wondering whether folks would be interested in a session that really focused on scores.  Are they good, are they bad, how do we live with them, what&#146;s their relationship to inquiry?&quot; So I felt a lot better after that, and she asked whether any of us might come to such a session.  So I said that I&#146;d like to (that was the first thing I said!), and she asked me to stay a little bit after class and chat, that she&#146;d like to talk with me.  I said (and then somebody asked me to whisper, which I really hadn&#146;t understood until then) that I might have to go if my baby started crying, but she sent me her email, and asked me for mine, if I didn&#146;t mind.  So I sent mine.  So that was pretty good, although I left feeling like I didn&#146;t know how I feel about getting into the score thing.   I mean, if people don&#146;t see it&#133;.  People just see things or they don&#146;t and there isn&#146;t much use in arguing about it.  And I don&#146;t know if I want to be in a place where people don&#146;t see the world my way.  That&#146;s the problem with this technology stuff, it&#146;s too complicated and distracting.  But she sent me email and asked if I was a classroom teacher and whether I had strong opinions about scores and said she liked to check in with people, especially new people, after there had been a disagreement to find out what was on their minds and see how the community could learn from it.  So that was neat, although I don&#146;t really know how to reply.</P>
