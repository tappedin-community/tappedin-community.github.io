If text is more than one word, objects with any of the words in them are returned. To find phrases, put quotes around the words. For example, if you type: FIND el nino <BR>
<BR>
<pre>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Searching for: el nino
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;... searching ...
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Found 7 instances.

------------------------<BR>
The Pros and Cons of Technology in the Classroom - a debate.<BR>
<BR>
The debate over the value and role of computing technology in K-12 classrooms rages on. Nationally recognized experts on the subject, Dr. Roy Pea and Dr. Larry Cuban, offer their insights in this transcript of speeches each gave to a gathering of organizations that fund school reform projects. Roy Pea is Director of the Center for Technology in Learning, SRI International. He was formerly Dean of the School of Education and Social Policy at Northwestern University.  He is currently on the National Academy of Science's Committee on Developments in the Sciences of Learning. Larry Cuban is a Professor of Education at Stanford University. He is author of Teachers and Machines: The Classroom Use of Technology Since 1920 and co-author of Tinkering Toward Utopia : A Century of Public School Reform (with David Tyack). <BR>
