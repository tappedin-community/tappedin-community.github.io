[5]  Announcing a Summer Workshop for Teachers<BR>
----------------------------------------------<BR>
--Teaching Steps to Tolerance--<BR>
<BR>
A one-week professional development program for fifth and sixth grade teachers and library media specialists. This workshop is brought to you by the Museum of Tolerance in Los Angeles, California.  The program (and associated travel) is funded by a grant through the U.S. Department of Education.  One week workshops will be held during the summer of 1998. <BR>
<BR>
Teams of up to five members  may apply.  Deadline for application is April 17, 1998.  For more information and an application packet please email tfadale@wiesenthal.com or call 310-843-0018.<BR>
<BR>
Educators today are faced with unique challenges in creating school communities with so many different cultures and religions coming together.  People come from more than 140 countries make their homes in the U.S.  Over 105 different languages are spoken within out schools.
Teaching Steps to Tolerance is a professional development activity that will explore creative ways for teaching tolerance and understanding.  <BR>
<BR>
Some of the activities that participants in the workshop will take part in are:   Explore issues of diversity, Experience the Museum of Tolerance as a workshop in human behavior, develop an understanding about teaching tolerance in the classroom, engage in dynamic discussions on the issues of tolerance, examine children's literature that promotes the teaching of tolerance, and explore multimedia technology to create classroom lessons and <BR>
student projects.<BR>
<BR>
[6] Collaborative Activity for students studying Civil Rights<BR>
-------------------------------------------------------------<BR>
Students of Brian Simmons at Thurgood Marshall High School in San Francisco will be studying Civil Rights in their history class in May. These juniors will be looking at the subject both historically and contemporarily from a variety of perspectives - both in terms of different cultural groups and different issues. They will be publishing their research as Web pages.<BR>
<BR>
It would be helpful to have a forum on civil rights, past and present, in order to explore the topic more deeply. Ideally, the forum would involve discussion with peers engaged in similar research as well as with experts in the field.<BR>
<BR>
If you are interested in participating in such a forum with your students or as an expert, please contact Technology Resource Teacher Hulda Nystrom or look up HuldaN when you log in to TAPPED IN.<BR>
<BR>
We hope to be get at least two classes of students (plus experts) interacting online in the Student Activities Center of TAPPED IN (see item [7]).<BR>
<BR>
