[1] Literature and Social Studies in TAPPED IN<BR>
----------------------------------------------<BR>
This month we’ve had some new topics in TAPPED IN After School Online sessions.  A special thanks goes to Michael Hutchison (MichaelAH in TAPPED IN) an award winning, Internet-using Social Studies teacher at Vincennes Lincoln High School in Indiana, led two discussions on combining cable programs with computer applications.  Discovery Channel School Online Educator Tish Raff co-hosted the second session with Michael.  <BR>
<BR>
Coming up next week is a literature discussion led by BJ Berquist.  She will be discussing this year's Newberry Award winner "Out of the Dust" by Karen Hesse.  BJ will share her personal teaching philosophy, "Sensory Literacy" as she explains why different inputs are necessary to help a person become truly literate.  Join BJ in TAPPED IN on Tuesday, July 28, at 3:30-4:30pm Pacific.  <BR>

[4] TAPPED IN goes to the White House (OSTP)<BR>
--------------------------------------------<BR>
On June 15,1998, TAPPED IN director (and reception greeter) Mark Schlager and representatives from the Kentucky Department of Education (Jay Roberts, Tim Smith, and Tom Peterson) and Los Angeles County Office of Education (Justine Germann) were invited to brief Dr. Arthur Bienenstock, Associate Director for Science, Dr. Nora Sabelli, and other Office of Science and Technology Policy staffers on KDE and LACOE plans to use TAPPED IN as part of their professional development communication and collaboration infrastructure.  After barely getting through security at the Old Executive Office Building, the briefing went off without a hitch!  Our thanks to KDE and LACOE for making a powerful case for the role of on-line communities like TAPPED IN in helping to scale up systemic reform programs.  If you would like to learn more about using TAPPED IN to help your organization support ongoing professional development then

[6] Ta Daa! TAPestry now works on Netscape 3 and 4 on both Mac and Windows!!!<BR>
-----------------------------------------------------------<BR>
We did some detective work, and found a work around for a bug in Netscape 4.05 on the Mac, so TAPestry now works fine with Netscape 3.01 and above on both Mac and Windows. (For the techies who are interested: calls to the requestFocus method on a TextArea object when using Netscape 4.05 crashes your Mac! TAPestry no longer makes such calls, and we reported the bug to Netscape).<BR>
