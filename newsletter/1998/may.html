[2] Summer Activities in TAPPED IN<BR>
----------------------------------<BR>
On May 26 at 3:30pm Pacific (Tuesday) we'll meet online to talk about what kinds of summer activities you want to see happen.  Via the MEETME mailing list we've talked about starting research groups for teachers, maybe a book discussion group, an open house for TAPPED IN, making a members page for TAPPED IN, discussing different pedagogical issues over the summer, and pairing up with to work on a collaborative projects for the next school year.  <BR>
<BR>
Come to the After School Online Town Hall meeting if you possibly can.  Get TAPPED IN over the summer to meet colleagues and plan your own professional development around your own interests.  Contact us
if you have ideas, but can't make the Town Hall meeting.<BR>
<BR>
[3]  Online Civil Rights Forum<BR>
------------------------------<BR>
Have you heard about the student Civil Rights Forum being held in TAPPED IN's Student Activities Center on May 26th? It involves an 11th grade US History class in San Francisco, a 9th grade Introduction to Social Science class in Indiana, and students in a correctional institution in Pennsylvania.<BR>
<BR>
Technology Resource Teacher Hulda Nystrom of Thurgood Marshall HS in San Francisco has conceived, organized and will be facilitating the forum. Joining her as facilitators are, in addition to the classroom teachers, a student teacher, a member of the Kentucky Department of Education, a Special Education teacher in Australia, the Technology Coordinator of the California International Studies Project, and a Project Manager at the Museum of Tolerance in Los Angeles. Structuring and coordination of the forum has taken place exclusively electronically - via email and in weekly planning meetings in TAPPED IN.<BR>
<BR>
The forum focus is to get a better understanding of the question, "What are Civil Rights?" In the past 2 weeks, students from all 3 states have worked in teams to come up with their own definitions of civil rights, and then exchanged them with each other electronically. During the forum, the California and Indiana students will discuss this question from the perspectives of 6 social groups: African Americans, Latinos, Asian Americans, court adjudicated youth, people with AIDS and women. The students in Pennsylvania do not have Internet access, so they are participating through their teacher's email.<BR>
<BR>
Look for more information on the outcome of the Civil Rights Forum in the near future. Be on the lookout for discussions with Hulda Nystrom (hnystrom@delong.org) on the planning process for conferencing and other online student collaboration. <BR>
<BR>
