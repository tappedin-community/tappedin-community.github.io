Quote of the Month:<BR>
"One of psychology's open secrets is the relative inability of grades, IQ, or SAT scores, despite their popular mystique, to predict unerringly who will succeed in life. ... At best, IQ contributes about 20 percent to the factors that determine life success ... emotional intelligence [includes] abilities such as being able to motivate oneself and persist in the face of frustrations; to control impulse and delay gratification; to regulate one's moods and keep distress from swamping the ability to think; to empathize and to hope."<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Daniel Goleman, Emotional Intelligence, 1995<BR>

Jackie Menasco and Erik Wilson are starting an ongoing discussion group in TAPPED IN to help teachers, and study issues involved with implementing standards in K-8 science classrooms. <BR>
<BR>
Jackie Menasco is an instructor at the Science and Mathematics Learning teachers. Erik Wilson is a National Science Foundation Postdoctoral Fellow at the University of California, San Francisco where he works on ways to support science teachers through the Internet.

Good news! At the beginning of October, Sun Microsystems awarded a grant to TAPPED IN for their top-of-the-line Enterprise Server.  This means that by the New Year, TAPPED IN response time will be 2-3 times faster and will be able to handle twice as many concurrent users than before!<BR>
<BR>
More good news! SRI has awarded TAPPED IN an internal grant to spiff up the TAPPED IN user interface.  Look for the new Web interface graphics around new years!<BR>

Would you like to have an icon or picture attached to your name? You can attach an icon to your TAPPED IN character (or any object that you own) very easily.<BR>
<BR>
First 20 people only: if you'd like to use a digitized picture of yourself (head shot only), but you're not sure how to make it an icon (32x32 pixels), we will make your icon for you on a first-come-first-served basis (no guarantee on turnaround time but we'll do the best we can). Send a digitized image either as an email attachment or sending us a URL with the image.<BR>

[5] Technology @ Your Fingertips: A Guide<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;-------------------------------------<BR>
The Department's National Center for Education  Statistics (NCES) produced a publication now available on the web, "Technology @ Your Fingertips: A Guide to Implementing Technology Solutions for Education Agencies &amp; Institutions."   The guide can be found at:  <BR>
http://nces.ed.gov/pubs98/tech/index2.htm or http://nces.ed.gov/pubs98/98293.pdf<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<BR>
This publication tells how to...<BR>
*  Define your needs &amp; technical requirements <BR>
*  Develop a "needs assessment"<BR>
*  Determine what resources you have &amp; what resources you will need<BR>
*  Implement, support, &amp; maintain your technology solution <BR>
*  Provide effective training...  And more.<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<BR>
The guide is aimed at persons who have been given the responsibility to set up computer and networking technology in an education organization, and persons who will be supervising the process of technology implementation.  It's not written for techies and it won't explain how to do something in a particular software package, but like its name implies gives a guides for making decisions about technology.  <BR>
