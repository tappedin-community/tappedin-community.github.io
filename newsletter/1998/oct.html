<BR>
Quote of the Month:<BR>
<BR>
"Dialogue launches language, the mind, but once it is launched we<BR>
develop a new power, 'inner speech,' and it is this that is<BR>
indispensible for our further development, our thinking. ... It is<BR>
through inner speech that the child develops his own concepts and<BR>
meanings; it is through inner speech that he achieves his own<BR>
identity; it is through inner speech, finally, that he constructs<BR>
his own world." - Oliver Sacks, Seeing Voices: A Journey into the World of the Deaf<BR>

On Thursday Oct 15, 1998 Patricia Cheng, a High School Teacher in<BR>
Danville, California, became TAPPED IN's Member #2000!  She will<BR>
receive a full-color TAPPED IN T-Shirt (what did you expect, a<BR>
car?)! A few members were on hand to congratulate Patricia when<BR>
she logged in:<BR>
<BR>
Mark [to PatriciaC]: "TaDa!!!! you're our 2000th member!"<BR>
DavidW exclaims, "Get out the champagne!"<BR>
PatriciaC [to you]: "I am?"<BR>
AmySi says, "that is so cool"<BR>
DavidW says, "Congratulations Patricia"<BR>
Mark lets the confetti loose<BR>
Mark blows his noisemaker!!<BR>
PatriciaC says, "Thanks everyone.  That is pretty cool."<BR>
AmySi exclaims, "Wooo hooooo!"<BR>
PattiWiz picks up Champagne.<BR>
PattiWiz exclaims, "Congratulations!"<BR>
PatriciaC accepts champagne<BR>
PatriciaC drinks a glass of the bubbly.<BR>
Mark asks, "So, how do you feel Patricia?"<BR>
PatriciaC says, "I'm feeling a little tipsy..."<BR>
PatriciaC grins<BR>
Mark asks, "so how did you find out about TAPPED IN (for our<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;newsletter)?"<BR>
PatriciaC says, "My professor from college sent us the URL."<BR>
PatriciaC says, "Her name is Jeanne Bamberger, from MIT."<BR>
Mark asks, "great and what do you hope to get out of your<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;membership?"<BR>
PatriciaC says, "I'm hoping I'll get cool ideas for my classes,<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;and make some connections, so I don't become<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;obsolete."<BR>
Mark asks, "OK! thats great!  what kinds of ideas can we help<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;you with?"<BR>
PatriciaC says, "Well, I teach math, so hopefully ideas that<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;relate to math."<BR>
Mark exclaims, "Boy you hit the jackpot today Patricia!"<BR>
<BR>
.It turns out that David Weksler from the Math Forum and Amy<BR>
Silberman from the Annenberg/CPB guide to Math and Science were<BR>
both on hand to help Patricia out!<BR>

[7] Anti-spam info: Hold the SPAM, please!<BR>
------------------------------------------<BR>
Thanks to our vigilant Director of Technology, Patti Schank, we've<BR>
taken several measures to protect you (and us) from SPAM--"junk<BR>
mail" that shows up in your email box from unwanted sources. Folks<BR>
who send SPAM often create software robots ('web-bots') that visit<BR>
web sites and harvest email addresses from them, looking especially<BR>
for addresses in an HTML 'mailto' link. For more information, see<BR>
<A HREF="http://spam.abuse.net/">http://spam.abuse.net/</A><BR>
<BR>
Here are the anti-SPAM measures we've taken:<BR>
<BR>
1. We've made it so that only mailing list members can submit<BR>
messages to TAPPED IN mailing lists (like meetme). Any mail sent<BR>
to it by a spamer will bounce. (Robots won't subscribe to a list.)<BR>
<BR>
2. We removed the 'mailto' email address links to TAPPED IN staff<BR>
sprinkled about our website, and in their place put one contact<BR>
form and one contact email address. The contact email address is<BR>
also disguised (using spaces before and after the '@' symbol) so<BR>
that web-bots can't understand it, but people can!<BR>
<BR>
3. HyperNews used to automatically generate 'mailto' links for<BR>
anyone who sent or replied to a message on a discussion. We<BR>
modified the HyperNews system so that it doesn't generate 'mailto'<BR>
links; rather it just lists the email address--but in a form (you<BR>
guessed it) disguised from web-bots. (The word "SENTFROM" is<BR>
prepended to all address. Unlike people, web-bots aren't smart<BR>
enough to remove it, and any addresses they'd gather would bounce.)<BR>
<BR>
So for now you need not worry about posting messages to our TAPPED<BR>
IN lists. Unlike posting to general Newsgroups, it's very unlikely<BR>
you will be added to anyone's junk mail list as a result!<BR>
