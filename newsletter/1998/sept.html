Quote of the Month:<BR>
<br>
"All kids are indeed capable of generating powerful ideas; they can rise to the occasion. It turns out that ideas are not luxuries gained at the expense of the 3 R's, but instead enhance them." - Deborah Meier, The Power of Their Ideas, 1995<BR>

On September 22, 1998 9am - 9pm PST TAPPED IN will have its first Open House.  We're calling it the TAPPED IN Block Party.  Come to the Block Party and get to know the neighborhood!  Meet the teachers,  staff developers, university professors, professional development providers, preservice teachers, and administrators that make the community what it is.  Come find out about online projects, great curriculum and resources, Internet based projects, and many exemplary uses of technology for collaborative activities.  <BR>

[2] September 14, 1998<BR>
----------------------<BR>
If you tried to log in on Monday, September 14, 1998, you may have experienced some difficulty.  Early in the morning, a squirrel and a transformer met up on the SRI Campus (where the TAPPED IN server lives).  We're sorry to report that neither the squirrel nor the transformer came out very well.  Electricity to all of SRI was out for approximately 19 hours.  We apologize if the electrical outage caused you any inconvenience.  We're back and everything is working fine again!  (We're looking into a back-up power source to prevent future downtime too.)<BR>
<BR>
[3] Bringing students online into TAPPED IN<BR>
-------------------------------------------<BR>

Are you looking for ways for your students to collaborate with people who are outside your classroom or school? Would you like them to engage in dialogue with others that goes beyond Questions and Answers? You can bring your students into TAPPED IN's Student Activities Center (SAC) with special student accounts.<BR>
<BR>
You can see an example of a student forum conducted in SAC last May by going to http://www.tappedin.org/info/resources.html and clicking on Civil Rights Forum.  At that site you can also see summaries of planning meetings for the Forum, and transcripts from the actual Civil Rights Forum itself.  Student forums can, of course, be done in any subject area. TAPPED IN Associate Educator Hulda Nystrom (Hulda or HuldaN) can help you plan your own event. <BR>
<BR>
[4] How to get a group started in TAPPED IN<BR>
-------------------------------------------<BR>
Over the past year, TAPPED IN staff and partners have helped numerous groups get started using TAPPED IN for their professional development.  On September 2, we called these groups together for a special After School Online session to pool their collective knowledge. A panel of experts shared their experience in motivating and orienting groups to incorporate TAPPED IN into their work.If you would like a copy of the transcript or a summary of the meeting,<BR>
visit the After School Online Room and get one from the transcript vendor. See Judi or Mark or Hulda online if you have questions.  If you have suggestions or tips to share with people just getting started in leading a group in TAPPED IN, email Mark Schlager contactus@tappedin.sri.com.<BR>
