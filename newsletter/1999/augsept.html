From 6:00pm PDT Friday, Sept. 17th through Sunday, Sept. 19th TAPPED IN will be unavailable due to the relocation of our server.  We apologize for any inconvenience.<BR>
**************<BR>
<BR>
[1] TAPPED IN goes to the National Education Summit <BR>
---------------------------------------------------<BR>
We're off to the National Education Summit!  We will be giving a technology demonstration in the Virtual Classroom at the Summit, which will be held September 30 - October 1, 1999 in Palisades, NY. The Virtual Classroom showcases innovative educational technology programs, prototypes, and products that improve student achievement, increase public engagement, and assist the current teaching force in acquiring new knowledge and skills. Governors, CEO's, Chief State School Officers, superintendents, principals, and other Summit attendees will gain first-hand experience with TAPPED IN.  President Clinton has been invited to speak, and it is likely he will do so!<BR>
<BR>
[2] New Discussion Groups for TAPPED IN<BR>
---------------------------------------<BR>
To kick off the school year, TAPPED IN announces four new discussion groups on Digital Imaging, Ed’s Oasis, K-8 Science, and High School Science.  <BR>
<BR>
The Digital Imaging discussion group will focus on VistaPro, DataSlate, ScionImage, and other software.  The group was formed at this summer's energizing Teach The Teachers Program, but one week was too short to master Digital Imaging.  The weekly meetings in TAPPED IN will be archived.  We will have an asynchronous web discussion board for the group to post and send current problems/solutions and to reflect on the meetings. We will meet in TAPPED IN’s Reception on Tuesdays at 7:00pm PDT.<BR>
<BR>
ED's Oasis will host "Evening at the Oasis" where we will introduce contest winners, present special guests, and lead tours of the best web sites for your classroom or workshops (same thematic schedule as ED’s Oracle newsletter). Post your questions in advance on the whiteboard in the Oasis CAFE in TAPPED IN or send them to: edie@edsoasis.org.  Meetings are every Thursday 5:30-6:30pm PDT.<BR>
<BR>
The K-8 Science Discussion Group will focus on implementing standards and innovative instructional approaches in K-8 science classrooms, but much of the agenda will be set at the first meeting based on your input!  Meetings start on Wednesday 9/15 from 4:00-5:00pm PDT.<BR>
<BR>
The High School Science Education Discussion Group encourages people to join for ANY reason that works for them!  They will meet in PaulDB's virtual office W609.  Meetings are from 5:00-6:00pm PDT starting on Wednesday, Sept. 22.<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
[3] There is still time to take the TAPPED IN survey!<BR>
-----------------------------------------------------<BR>
We wish to thank all those who have taken the time to complete our survey -- this is our primary means of getting feedback that will enable us to continue improving TAPPED IN.  For those of you who haven’t filled it out yet, you still have time.<br>
<BR>
[4] WebTour Updated!<BR>
--------------------<BR>
The WebTour is a great way to acquaint yourself with TAPPED IN, particularly for new or prospective members.  More experienced members may want to skim through the WebTour to see if they have been utilizing all of the various resources in TAPPED IN.   We recently updated the WebTour to reflect the new TAPPED IN layout.  In addition, we simplified the tour to be less daunting for new users.  The new sections are as follows:<BR>
1)  What can teachers do in TAPPED IN?<BR>
2)  Can I sample TAPPED IN right now?<BR>
3)  How can I become a member?<BR>
4)  More information about TAPPED IN<BR>
<BR>
[5] Getting Students TAPPED IN Part I<BR>
-------------------------------------<BR>
Ever worry if it’s worth bringing your class into TAPPED IN because you want to maintain the just-for-teachers atmosphere?  Good news! There is a special Student Activities Center (SAC) that was designed specially for student use. Special student accounts can be requested by members of TAPPED IN. These accounts only permit access to the SAC and to an "outdoor" section of TAPPED IN called the Campus Center. <BR>
<BR>
There are three web pages to help teachers use TAPPED IN with their students. With these pages you can... <BR>
1) Request accounts for student access:<BR>
http://www.tappedin.org/info/students/join.html<BR>
<BR>
2) Get examples and links to projects that were done by members:<BR>
http://www.tappedin.org/info/classroom.html<BR>
<BR>
3) And get procedures, tips and ways to use TAPPED IN for collaborative learning:<br>

[6] ChuckM (help desk) waves bye and heads for the PALY<BR>
-------------------------------------------------------<BR>
This summer I had the privilege of working alongside Judi Fusco, Mark Schlager, Patti Schank and Hunter Gehlbach at TAPPED IN. Rather, at SRI. That is, I had a computer in an office in a building (SRI in Menlo Park, CA) as well as my office in a building in a computer (South 504 in TAPPED IN.)  This real vs. virtual world thing is getting a little fuzzy.<BR>
<BR>
I worked the HelpDesk beside BJ Berquist, David Fish and other Help Desk Volunteers. This is a great experience for those who want to deepen their online skills. I learned a lot about communicating online and developed my presentation skills. I became proficient enough to be accused by a guest of being an automated message! (Not sure that was a GOOD thing.) SHAMELESS PLUG ALERT: Please consider joining the Help Desk volunteers!<BR>
<BR>
I also gathered information about student use of TAPPED IN. At the September 23rd After School Online session, I will co-lead a discussion on ways to use TAPPED IN with students. Speaking of whom, I will return to mine again on August 31st. I wish you all an excellent school year. <BR>
<BR>
ChuckM waves see you!<BR>
<BR>
[7] Discover Learning Styles<BR>
----------------------------<BR>
On October 12-14 1999, you are invited to attend "Using Learning Styles to Improve Student Success" sponsored by the Distance Learning Resource Network (DLRN).<BR>
<BR>
Dr. Carla Lane will moderate this free online event. Participants will engage in message forums (asynchronous) and a real time (synchronous) break out session, identify their students' preferred learning styles (as well as their own), and discuss how integrating preferred modes of learning into their existing classes can improve the student learning experience. <BR>
<BR>
EVENT LOGISTICS: <BR>
<BR>
The real-time session will take place in TAPPED IN at the After School Online session on Wednesday October 13th  from 4:00-5:30pm PDT.  Some sessions might have size limits so sign up now. Hope you can join us for this very valuable event!<BR>
