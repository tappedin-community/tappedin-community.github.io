[1] After School Online is as easy as A-S-O – by BJ Berquist<BR>
------------------------------------------------------------<BR>
After School Online is a forum for teachers to share their successes, compare notes on challenges to teaching and learn new ways of doing things.  You don't have to sign up or let anyone know in advance if you'd like to attend After School Online... Just (A)ttend by choosing the session you want from the Calendar of Events; (S)how up a few minutes before the session is scheduled to start; and (O)bserve and participate... It's that easy!<BR>
<BR>
Each month we email you descriptions of the ASO sessions.  If you don't see something that interests you one month, keep checking because our topics change monthly.  If times aren't good for you, or you'd like to see a specific topic covered, let us know, we listen and make changes according to your feedback!  Also, transcripts are available if you can't make a session--just log in and ask for more information.<BR>

[2] Help TAPPED IN, Help Yourself! - by Hunter Gehlbach<BR>
-------------------------------------------------------<BR>
Volunteers serve an invaluable function for TAPPED IN, helping guide new members into and through the community. In addition, volunteers gain some personal benefits.  By sitting in on the HelpDesk even for just an hour per week, one's knowledge of TAPPED IN will grow exponentially.  By continuing to interact regularly with the HelpDesk staff, you'll find that you will continue to pick up new tricks, receive staff support and training, and form close collegial bonds.  <BR>
<BR>
As you can see from our helpdesk schedule there is tremendous flexibility in our hours. However, there are still a few gaps in the schedule.  As TAPPED IN continues to grow and more members log in, it will be even more of an asset to have two HelpDesk volunteers online at the same time. If you have any questions, have an interest in volunteering, or even just want to  learn more tricks of the trade, please email us. By contributing as little as one hour per week you will be helping your community and helping yourself.<BR>

[3] Science in the Real World - by Judi Fusco<BR>
=============================================<BR>
The Leonids are coming.... The Leonid meteor shower occurs every November, but this November they are supposed to be especially strong.   Some experts are estimating over 1000 shooting stars per hour.  No matter where you live, the interval between 10 p.m. on November 17 and dawn on November 18 will probably be the best time to look for Leonids in 1999 according to a Nasa website.  See <A HREF="http://www.thursdaysclassroom.com/11nov99/meteorcounts.html">http://www.thursdaysclassroom.com/11nov99/meteorcounts.html</A> for more info!<BR>

[6] Tech-Tip of the Month - MY ITEMS<BR>
------------------------------------<BR>
Objects (also called 'supplies') are available in TAPPED IN to help make online communication more effective.  Examples of objects include notes, personal recorders, vending machines, surveys, pets and many other things. Once you get an object from supplies you can type HELP objectname to learn even more about it.   <BR>
<BR>
Ever wonder what happens when you click on the notepad and you don't see anything...or you go to supplies and click on something, but don't know where to find it?  Go to MY ITEMS on the web window or type AUDIT in the text window and you will see all the objects you own.  If you have objects that you don't want or need, type TRASH object name (or TRASH #xxxx - the number of the object that appears in the MY ITEMS list).<BR>
<BR>
