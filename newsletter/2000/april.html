[2] Math Forum: Bridging Research and Practice Group (BRAP), by Roya Salehi<BR>
===========================================================================<BR>
Join the Math Forum on Monday, April 24th, for a tour of the videopaper, "Encouraging Mathematical Thinking: Discourse around a Rich Problem" and an opportunity to interact with some of the authors.<BR>
<BR>
In an attempt to integrate practice and research, this videopaper by the Math Forum's Bridging Research &amp; Practice Group (BRAP) of teacher practitioners and Math Forum Staff reports on findings culled from discussions of research articles and chapters, classroom practice, and videotapes of classroom teaching, noting links between these findings and research into student learning and instruction. It incorporates video clips from the teachers' classrooms, and provides a challenge Cylinder Problem with lessons for various levels and student predictions of outcomes. The videopaper is located at: http://mathforum.com/brap/wrap/<BR>

[3] Technology Tools and Active Learning - by Pam Berger<BR>
========================================================<BR>
Join Pam Berger, author of Internet for Active Learners: K-12 Curriculum Strategies, to explore new Web-based tools that can be used to encourage and support engaged, active learning. Placed within the context of inquiry learning a new tool will be explored and discussed each month for the next five months to analyze its potential to support learning. <BR>
<BR>
The first session, on April 27th at 4 pm PDT, will take a look at CyberTours, a thematic, web-based interactive tour. In the months to follow we will explore Keeboo, Hunts and Third Voice.<BR>
<BR>
[4] HelpDesk Wants YOU, by BJ Berquist <BR>
======================================<BR>
You've been there...logged in as a 'newbie' and a bit overwhelmed... then suddenly, you were greeted by a friendly and helpful person who answered the $64,000 question of "what do I do now?"... and helped you learn your way around the environment.  <BR>
<BR>
TAPPED IN's HelpDesk volunteers were all newbie's at one point too... but now they are giving back to the TAPPED IN community by spending just an hour or two a week on HelpDesk duty.  With a membership of over 8000, our HelpDesk volunteers are needed more than ever, especially as the membership increases greatly as summer workshops are conducted. <BR>
<BR>
If you sign up for HelpDesk, you'll first receive training and support, and apprentice with a more experienced member. There is also a monthly WaterCooler Confab where the volunteers can meet and discuss HelpDesk experiences. Join us at the WaterCooler which occurs each month--check the calendar--to learn more.<BR>
<BR>
[5] NEW!  Time Zone Friendly Calendar of Events<BR>
===============================================<BR>
To make it easier for our global TAPPED IN community to know when events are scheduled in their time zone, a new feature has been added.  You can now simply click on your time zone on the calendar and see the times posted in your local time.  If we've missed a zone that is important to you, contact us.<BR>

[6] Caps and Gowns in Bits and Bytes, by Julie Duffield <BR>
=======================================================<BR>
Distance Learning Resource Network (DLRN) invites you to participate in an interview with Dr. Sharon Johnston, curriculum specialist of The Florida High School (FHS) a virtual high school. This interview will take place as a session in the After School Online (ASO) of Tapped In on Wednesday, May 10th.

[7] Ten Homework Tips from The Schwab Foundation for Learning  <BR>
=============================================================<BR>
Research shows that when parents become involved in their children's schoolwork, the children do better in school. One way you can get involved is by helping your child with homework. It will benefit both your child's school work and self-esteem.  Look for upcoming sessions in TAPPED IN where we get together to discuss tips for getting parents more involved in their children’s education.  <BR>
<BR>
<a href="http://www.schwablearning.org">The Schwab Foundation for Learning</a> has "Ten Homework Tips" to help moms and dads help their LD kids with homework. To read this article, please go to http://www.schwablearning.org/main.asp?page=2.9.3pubs=parent&amp;id=255.<BR>
<BR>
(Editor's Note: These ten tips look pretty good for parents of all kids, not just kids with a LD.)<BR>
<BR>
[8] Digital Generation Gap?<BR>
===========================<BR>
Some say that the digital divide is also a generation gap, as today's teens make the web and email an integral part of their lives. They can't see living without it, and their parents just don't get it.<BR>
<BR>
