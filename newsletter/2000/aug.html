[1] New to TAPPED IN: KIKO (Knowledge In, Knowledge Out) <BR>
========================================================<BR>
The newest on-line educational company, Kiko (http://www.kiko.com) has joined the TAPPED IN community, and they're excited to be here!  At Kiko, real people teach and learn from each other in a community where educators create and share on-line lessons.  Kiko is simple and free to join.  Check out the new WebQuest Center (http://webquest.kiko.com), with featured quests and templates (see an example WebQuest lesson at http://www.kiko.com/Nicholson/shakespeare-s-the-tempest--a-film-proposal-webquest).  Kiko provides the easy-to-use tools and hosting, you provide your knowledge and passion about teaching to share with the world.<BR>  
<BR>
Come to Kiko's first ASO session on September 6th at 4:00 PM PDT/7:00 PM EST to get started, and feel free to visit their suite on the second floor to find example lessons and templates.  No fancy programming skills are required, and everyone is welcome!<BR><BR>

[2] Technology in the Issue-Oriented Science Class <BR>
==================================================<BR>
SEPUP is hosting a seminar series in TAPPED IN to evaluate the use of technology tools in issue-oriented science classrooms. The series will explore and critique various tools that increase student learning, enhance teacher development, or improve class management. Strategies for practical, effective ways to integrate them into real classrooms will be a key focus of the series. During the seminar, participants will tour sites together, hear from guest speakers, share classroom experiences and discuss the merits of certain technology tools. All members of the Tapped In community are welcome at any session, but they will build from one to the next, so we hope that people will come to more than one.<br>
<BR>
[2] PBS Democracy Project <BR>
=========================<BR>
All educators are invited to join Michael Hutchison, social studies teacher, along with Joe Hammond and Mary Halnon, both producers at PBS, as they highlight the PBS "Democracy Project", which begins this month.  The project includes resources for both high school and grades 3-6, 15 supporting lesson plans, and a separate kids' area with online games, as well as a "Build Your Own Campaign" activity.

[3] New! Technology in the Classroom, by Donna Hendry <BR>
=====================================================<BR>
Intended to help the average teacher and school in the world of educational technology, Technology in the Classroom will begin providing workshops in conjunction with a new supporting mail list on September 11, 2000.  We recognize that for our children to succeed in the world beyond our schools, we all, student and teacher alike, will need a firm background in the technological field.  We are also aware of the vast and ever-growing resources available to the teacher on the Internet and understand the need to go beyond these resources.  The teachers in the trenches need help.  We want to give teachers the one stop to find out everything they need to know to use technology successfully in their classrooms and schools. Visit <a href="http://www.techforteachers.org/">http://www.techforteachers.org/</a> for a preview.  See you at TAPPED IN on September 11th, 5pm-6pm PDT/8pm-9pm EDT!

[4] Eisenhower National Clearinghouse (ENC)<BR>
===========================================<BR>
Join Gail Hoskins, Senior Outreach Coordinator, at a special Tapped-In
Session on September 12, 4:00-5:00pm PST/7:00pm-8:00pm EDT and learn about the newly revised ENC Online.  The Eisenhower National Clearinghouse (ENC) has recently launched an all-new web site, ENC Online, at <a href="http://enc.org">http://enc.org</a>. ENC provides K-12 math and science educators with a central source of information about teaching materials, innovative ideas, and professional development.
<BR><BR>
Content on ENC Online has been organized into four major categories -  Curriculum Resources where teachers can find all types of teaching materials; Web Links which has helpful links including ENC's Digital Dozen (changes monthly); Professional Resources includes a timesavers section (who couldn't use a bit more time?); and Topics an area which addresses key education issues such as inquiry and problem solving, integrating educational technology, equity, and assessment.  <BR>

[5] Abracadabra! by BJ Berquist<BR>
===============================<BR>
As a newbie to the world of computers, when I heard the term wizard I pictured a person in a tall pointy hat with stars and moons on it - and of course they waved a magic wand!  How else do you get computers to work if it isn't by magic?  And then I met Richard and Patti and I knew that what I had imagined was true... well, maybe not the hat and wand part, but they certainly are magicians when it comes to keeping TAPPED IN up and running.  Richard Godard and Patti Schank are the wizards of TAPPED IN.  Patti, in California, is the technology director.  Richard, working from across the continent in eastern Canada, is the archwizard.  They both work on programming and are constantly tweaking the system to make sure that when you say or do something it actually happens on your screen.<BR>
<BR>
Talking, emoting, moving to another room, getting an office, attaching an icon and all the gazillions of tiny details that a visitor to TAPPED IN takes for granted are all under the influence of their special wizardry.  Although Patti and Richard are kind to technophobes and really, really nice, if you see them logged in remember they are hard at work performing magic for our community!<BR>

[6] New TAPPED IN Staff member - Kari Craig<BR>
===========================================<BR>
Hello!  I'm Kari Craig, and I came on board with the TAPPED IN team here in sunny Menlo Park, California early this summer.  I graduated from Allegheny College in Pennsylvania this past May with a B.S. in Psychology and a minor in Computer Science.  I'm very interested in how we can best use computers in the classroom.<BR>
<BR>
Soon I will be moving to Wisconsin where I will continue to work for TAPPED IN.  This summer I have met and worked with several of you online at TAPPED IN, via email, and through face-2-face training sessions. I look forward to working with many more of you this fall!  If I can be of any assistance, please contact us.<BR>
