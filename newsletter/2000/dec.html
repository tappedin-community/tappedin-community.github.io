[1] Warm Wishes for the Holiday Season from the TAPPED IN Team<BR>
==============================================================<BR>
This year has been a busy one--when aren't they?!  First, we want to thank each and every one of you for joining and being part of TAPPED IN.  Our membership has now grown to over 9,000 and each month over 10% of you log in.  Even though we've gotten so big, we still truly believe that every member in TAPPED IN brings something valuable to contribute--a new perspective, knowledge to share, a question, or enthusiasm for teaching and learning.  We hope that you find value in being able to share and learn with other educators online in the community.<BR>
 <BR>
As we grow as a community, we see more and more instances of how much each of you cares and wants to help others reach their full potential as an educator.  We believe that this caring is what sets TAPPED IN apart from other places.  If you haven't yet experienced the benefits of our community, log in or email us and talk with us about how to get involved.  Being part of a community and taking full advantage of its offerings initially takes a little effort, but members who are involved tell us the rewards very much outweigh the effort.  If you find yourself too busy, and want to keep reading our newsletter and &quot;lurking&quot; in the community, that is ok too.  Join us whenever you can--we'll be here.<BR>

[2] The 3 Rs: Reading, Responsibility &amp; Respect - by BJ Berquist<BR>
====================================================================<BR>
Our TAPPED IN community is growing rapidly.  We now have almost 9000 members!  This means more resources for us all and greater attendance at the scheduled public discussions.  It also sometimes means that newer community members may not be familiar with online discussion etiquette.  This can be time consuming, disruptive, and frustrating for participants and discussion leaders.  Please take a few moments to review the 3 R's so that everyone can have a successful discussion experience.<BR>
<BR>
It's a good idea to log on 10 to 15 minutes before a discussion is scheduled to begin.  This lets the HelpDesk direct you to the right room.  When you enter the room where the discussion is taking place take time to READ the dialogue that may scroll on your screen.  Keep in mind that when you enter text in the SAY window and press return you are talking to everyone in the room even if you direct your comment to a single person.<BR>
<BR>
Be RESPONSIBLE for your dialogue.  If you want to talk to someone and not disturb the discussion, whisper to that person (type:  /wh nameofperson and your comment)  The moderator or facilitator of the discussion may establish ground rules for asking questions.  You may be asked to post questions to the whiteboard, whisper them to the facilitator, or ask them at a designated time.<BR>
<BR>
Discussion leaders are members of the TAPPED IN community and volunteer their time to present discussion topics.  RESPECT their contribution by listening to what they have to say and by contributing to the dialogue.  TAPPED IN values its members and hopes that with your help each discussion will be a positive productive learning experience for everyone involved.<BR>

[6] New JigsawHelper Discussion Group to start in January<BR>
=========================================================<BR>
http://www.jigsawhelper.org is a free community that helps teachers learn and use the Jigsaw Grouping Method with the Web.  Research has shown that even occasional use of the Jigsaw Grouping Method can improve academic learning, while reducing gender bias, and racial conflict (Aronson, The Jigsaw Classroom, 1997).  Anyone interested in the advantages of using the Jigsaw Grouping Method with the Web to help teachers write and/or use Jigsaw Activities is invited to join Fred Steinbroner on the third Tuesday of every month, beginning on Tuesday January 16, 2001.  Together we can climb toward higher academic achievement, gender equality, and racial harmony in our schools.<BR>
<BR>
[7] QED: Teacher internet use grows more sophisticated<BR>
======================================================<BR>
Quality Education Data findings show that there are a growing number of teachers using the internet for evaluating curriculum, lesson planning, and professional development.<BR>
