Quote of the Month<BR>
"... I'm concerned about hate groups.  ...  We must create a climate where people agree that human beings are more alike than unalike.  The only way to do that is through education." - Maya Angelou (Reprinted with permission from Parade, copyright c 1999)<BR>

[1] Alternative/Correctional Ed Discussion Group recognized by CEA<BR>
------------------------------------------------------------------<BR>
Designed to address some pressing issues facing teachers in correctional and alternative education, the Alternative/Correctional Ed Discussion Group, led by BJ Berquist and Dave Fish, bring attention to the problems and special needs of this "forgotten population."  The group meets the third Thursday of each month and tries to provide opportunities for these isolated educators to go 'out of the box' in looking at solutions to their unique situations.  An article about TAPPED IN and this discussion group was published in the Correctional Education Association Bulletin.<BR>

[7] TAPPED IN Survey Report, by Judi Fusco<BR>
------------------------------------------<BR>
A BIG wholehearted thanks to all those who participated in our first comprehensive survey of membership experiences in TAPPED IN.  1269 of you filled out the survey.  For those who participated in the survey we had a raffle and we've picked the four winners.  We are notifying them by email and will announce them in next month's newsletter (with their permission).<BR>
<BR>
Each month we'll take a little space at the end of the newsletter and tell you more about what we are learning from the survey.  For example, we learned that the average age of TAPPED IN survey respondents is 43.72 with a range of 21-67.  <BR>
<BR>
We were also pleased to learn the range of teaching experience in TAPPED IN.  Teacher members have taught from .5 years to 39 years (25% of respondents have taught 5 years or less, 25% from 6 years to 13 years, 25% from 14 years to 21 years and 25% from 22 years to 39 years).  <BR>
<BR>
Because we are a community of practice where we often learn from each other, it's important to have a wide-range of expertise.  It's easy to see how experienced teachers would be an important resource in TAPPED IN, as they have most likely learned a great deal throughout their career, but everyone has something to offer.  Often people who are new to a profession raise questions that cause experienced people to reflect on issues that they all to often take for granted.  TAPPED IN can be a wonderful place to have a reflective conversation with another teacher regardless of how long you've been teaching.
