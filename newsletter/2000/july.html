[1] Welcome to Summertime at TAPPED IN!<br>
=======================================<br>
Whether you are a veteran or a newbie, there's something for everyone this summer at TAPPED IN.  Take some time to look at the Calendar of Events... if you don't see something that interests you, now's the time to speak up!  Some wise person once said, "If you don't see the light at the end of the tunnel, march right down and turn it on."  There are lots of new members joining our Community of Practice from the summer workshops.  If you are new and not sure how to do things, attend one of the New to TAPPED IN sessions during the week or on Saturday.<br>
<br>
[2] New to TAPPED IN: K-3rd Teacher Resources Series<br>
====================================================<br>
Christina Wilder, an Education Associate working for TAPPED IN this summer, has scheduled four After School Online sessions for teachers of K-3rd grades.  Christina has taught grades K-8 in San Francisco for 31 years, with many years in K-3rd classrooms and 18 years using computers in 1st-8th grades.  She has great sites to share and discuss in Language Arts, Math/Science, Social Science and Utilities.  All K-3rd teachers out there who are doing great things, and others who would like resources to do more great stuff are invited to get together to share! Please join Christina at TAPPED IN in August.  Check the Calendar for dates and times.<br>
<br>
[3] Making a list and checking it twice...<br>
==========================================<br>
Mailing lists are a great way to keep up with your favorite topic at TAPPED IN.  Because there are so many issues we would like to discuss and time is at such a premium for busy educators, TAPPED IN has started several email lists that you can join if you would like an additional way to be part of the discussion.  Miss a "chat" and don't have time to retrieve the transcript from the ASO?  Check the mailing list to see what's going on.  Or use the list to suggest a topic of discussion that is important to you.  You can subscribe to the following moderated lists (these topic-specific lists are meant to be used by TAPPED IN participants and are not intended to compete or conflict with any other lists or bulletin boards):

construction and use.  PALS is continually adding new assessment
tasks, so visit PALS to check out the latest features!
<br><br>
*PALS has recently added a new section for teachers which provides PALS
tasks mapped to the FOSS curriculum kits with STC kits to be added soon.
*Teachers in Texas can now search PALS via their own TEKS(Texas Essential Knowledge & Skills - standards).  Visit PALS at <a href="http://pals.sri.com">http://pals.sri.com</a>.

[5] Pennsylvania Governor's Institute for Arts Educators<br>
========================================================<br>
BJ Berquist, Associate Educator at TAPPED IN and an art teacher, attended the Pennsylvania Governor's Institute for Arts Educators held from July 9-14, 2000 at Gannon University in Erie, PA.  BJ is using the online virtual community TAPPED IN to continue the rich dialogue that was begun at the Institute.  Arts educators from all disciplines, including music, dance, theater and visual arts, are invited to log in to TAPPED IN on the first Monday of each month at 7pm EDT/4pm PDT to learn more about the Institute and the programs that were implemented.
<br><br>
[6] Summer Carnival: The Melody Lingers On<br>
==========================================<br>
The cotton candy has been wiped from the keyboards and the big red rubber noses have been packed away.  The second TAPPED IN Summer Carnival is over, but the carousel music is still echoing through the community.  If you didn't have an opportunity to attend the Carnival, or if you want to revisit some of the discussions, you can get one of the archived transcripts available in the After School Online room in the "Summer Carnival 2000" emailer. <br><br>

[7] Linguistic Olympics - by Thomas Payne<br>
=========================================<br>
The Linguistic Olympics is a unique activity that combines cultural awareness and analytic reasoning. At the Linguistic Olympics, students compete by solving linguistic problems in real languages they have never learned. Join us on August 29 as we visit and explore the possibilities of this activity.
