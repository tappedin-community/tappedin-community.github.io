Florida High School is a virtual high school which officially began in 1996 for the purpose of creating a complete diploma granting high school online.

[6] More of the same old blah, blah, blah?<BR>
==========================================<BR>
If you think that online chats are superficial and shallow, think again!  TAPPED IN knows that your time is valuable and strives to make sure that the topics that are offered will meet your educational/professional development needs.  You can now visit our web page of links to past discussions and get an idea of what a TAPPED IN synchronous conversation looks like.  Once you've taken a look at a couple of transcripts your hardest decision will be which discussion to join!<BR>
<BR>
[7] Technology Tips - Archived Transcripts<BR>
==========================================<BR>
Now that you've had a taste of what a transcript looks like on the Online Transcripts page, how about taking a look at the many archived transcripts in the After School Online room?  Hectic schedules often make it difficult to attend a discussion, but you can view transcripts of many of the events that are on the calendar by going to the ASO emailers.  If you don't know how to access the emailer, stop by TAPPED IN when a HelpDesk person is on duty and they will show you what to do.<BR>
