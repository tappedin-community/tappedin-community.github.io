New Interface! - by Judi Fusco<BR>
------------------------------<BR>
If you haven't logged in yet this summer, come for the Summer Carnival and try out our new version of TAPestry!!  Our newest version of TAPestry (our user interface) makes TAPPED IN even easier to use.  Just go to our regular membership page and log in.  With the new interface you don't have to remember commands.  You don't have to type a quote (") to talk, and there are more "clickable" things making it even easier to get around to the different rooms and use the objects in the environment.  Many of our members have told us how much they like it.  Come give it a try and let us know what you think!<BR><BR>

If you liked the old interface, don't worry, we've designed the new one with that in mind and you can switch a couple of settings and have the old "look and feel" back.  Ask a Help Desk member or check out the documentation on our Help page.<BR>
