Quote of the Month - &quot;Without community service, we would not have a strong quality of life.  It's important to the person who serves as well as the recipient.  It's the way in which we ourselves grow and develop...&quot; - Dr. Dorothy I. Height, President and CEO of the National Council of Negro Women

<h2>[1] Thank you, TAPPED IN volunteers!</h2>

April, Volunteer Recognition Month, is a wonderful time to stop and thank the TAPPED IN volunteers for all they do for the TAPPED IN community.  Discussion leaders, HelpDesk Volunteers, and community members who take a moment to answer questions from guests and new members contribute to the rapidly growing success of the TAPPED IN environment.  (By the time this article reaches you, the international TAPPED IN membership will have passed 11,000!)  If you are interested in contributing your time at the TAPPED IN HelpDesk, a mentoring program will get you started.  Do you have an idea for a discussion group but are not sure where to start?  Participate in some ASO discussions and observe experienced discussion leaders model the dynamics of successful discussions (see [3]).  And, when a TAPPED IN volunteer answers your questions or leads a discussion, be sure to give them a big THANK YOU!

<h2>[2] Member Perspective: William Wilson</h2>

WilliamCW (Bill) is currently a science teacher and technology coordinator for Richmond Hill HS in New York City.  He is the forum coordinator for TAPPED IN's Technology Coordinator's and Science Teacher's Forums.<BR>

<h2>[3] The Community of TAPPED IN: ASO Leaders</h2>

Have you seen our Calendar of Events lately?  These "After School Online" discussions are led or co-led by volunteer members of TAPPED IN.  They provide a wonderful way to share resources, meet colleagues, and learn about the community.  You can read some background information about our wonderful ASO leaders at http://www.tappedin.org/info/asoleaders.html.   If you have an idea for a new ASO topic and are interested in leading or co-leading, please fill out our ASO Session Proposal Form.

<h2>[4] New ASO Series: The 4th D Crossing</h2>

HelpDesk Volunteer, Susanne Nyrop (SusanneN), is working with the Global Educators' Network (GEN) to discuss how online communities are developed and used.
