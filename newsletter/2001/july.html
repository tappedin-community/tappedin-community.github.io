Quote of the Month - &quot;The source of genius is imagination alone, the refinement of the senses that sees what others do not see, or sees them differently..&quot; - Eugene Delacroix

<h2>[1] Summer Carnival 2001: Crazy Eights!</h2>

Mark 8/8 8-8 PDT on your calendar!  The third annual TAPPED IN Summer Carnival of learning and fun is scheduled for Wednesday, August 8, 2001 from 8am to 8pm Pacific Daylight Time (11 to 11 Eastern).  Invite friends and colleagues and enjoy a day of exciting and informative presentations!

<h2>[2] SIG Gem of the Month: Tech Coordinator's Forum</h2>

Special Interest Group (SIG) Discussions try to meet the needs and address the issues of specific groups of educators.  For currently active groups take a look at the calendar of events.  The following dialogue is from a Technology Coordinator's Forum on CIPA.<BR>
<BR>
DonaldB asks, &quot;Whether we agree with filtering or not, isn't it a done deal for e-rate funding?&quot;<BR>
<BR>
KarenRL says, &quot;I think so.&quot;<BR>
<BR>
GregJR asks, &quot;What is e-rate funding??&quot;<BR>
<BR>
WilliamCW says, &quot;but many of the offsite programs may be doing some of the same thing - one needs to check their privacy statements&quot;<BR>
<BR>
DonaldB says, &quot;In the US the G-Ment funds internet access&quot;<BR>
<BR>
KarenRL says, &quot;But that's a heck of a carrot to be dangling in front of schools - economics versus impeding students access to information.&quot;<BR>
<BR>
DonaldB says, &quot;with a number of strings attached...&quot;<BR>
<BR>
WilliamCW says, &quot;well its a done deal for now - but there will probably be court battles like the ALA's about it in the next couple of years&quot;<BR>
<BR>

<h2>[3] Technology Tips</h2>

<i>Using Whiteboards</i><BR>
Whiteboards, found in most rooms at TAPPED IN, can be used in several ways.  An agenda for a meeting can be posted, questions listed for a class to answer, or notes of important points can be kept during a meeting. To write on a whiteboard click on WHITEBOARD on the room drawing, scroll down and enter your text in the input window.  Click on the WRITE ON WHITEBOARD button.  You can click on RELOAD to update the whiteboard window.  PRINT TO NOTE converts the text on the whiteboard into a note which you can see if you go to MY ITEMS.<BR>

<b>[4] What others are saying about us...</b><BR>
<BR>
TAPPED IN member, Anna Martin, has a column in the August 2001 NAEA News, the bimonthly newsletter of the National Art Education Association.  She writes:  The Internet, with its speed, graphics capabilities, and flexibility, is an ideal medium for collaborative projects. This summer, EMIG (Electronic Media Interest Group) will test the limits of on-line collaboration by planning a project in a virtual conference center.  We invite NAEA members and the EMIG community to participate in a series of activities scheduled for fall in this virtual space. Assisting in this endeavor is BJ Berquist, an art educator and member of the EMIG electronic mail list.  BJ will help us to use the resources of the TAPPEDIN virtual conference center to plan and complete a collaborative art project. The theme of the project is &quot;blanket the world in peace.&quot; (Ed. note:  TAPPED IN's ArtsSites is hosting this series and meets on the first Thursday of each month.  All arts educators and arts organizations are invited to participate.  Plans may include a multimedia collection of art, music, dance, and poetry)  For more information about NAEA visit <a href="http://www.naea-reston.org/">http://www.naea-reston.org/</a>.<BR>
