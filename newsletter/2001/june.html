Quote of the Month - &quot;We don't stop playing because we grow old; we grow old because we stop playing.&quot; - George Bernard Shaw

<h2>[1] Summer Carnival 2001</h2>

The guide in searching for this month's quote was the enthusiastic exclamation of a new member, &quot;I never knew learning could be so much fun!&quot;  Educators especially value the importance of play and Summer Carnival is where the fun happens!  On August 8 from 8am to 8pm PDT a series of events is being scheduled for TAPPED IN members and guests that promises to provide lots of playtime.  Already on the agenda are an Australian Bar-B-Q, a discussion led by Lynne Schrum about online courses, and a return of the ever popular Pet Show.  To get a taste of what previous Carnivals have offered, go to the After School Online Transcript Emailer and look at the Summer Carnival 1999 and Summer Carnival 2000 transcripts.

<h2>[2] From your point of view: Member perspectives</h2>

Each month we try to highlight one of our members and ask them to share their experiences with TAPPED IN.  Members will explain how they found out about TAPPED IN, things they particularly enjoy about it, and how they personally utilize TAPPED IN as an educator.  We post these <a href="/tappedin/web/perspectives/">member perspectives</a> online and also feature them here in our newsletter.  If you are interested telling folks how you use TAPPED IN and or have a suggestion for another member that you would like to see featured in our member perspectives, let us know!  It's a great way to get to know one another, learn from each other, and build our community!

<h2>[3] SIG Gem of the Month: Alternative/Correctional Ed</h2>

Special Interest Group (SIG) Discussions try to meet the needs and address the issues of specific groups of educators.  For currently active groups take a look at the calendar of events.  The following dialogue is from an Alternative/Correctional Ed discussion on Media Literacy.<BR>
<BR>
AllaB says, &quot;The basic media literacy skills can be used to construct, as well as deconstruct media messages.&quot;<BR>
<BR>
BJB [HelpDesk] nods to Alla.<BR>
<BR>
BJB says, &quot;This empowers our students to be effective communicators.&quot;<BR>
<BR>
KarenSN [WebCT] says, &quot;They could even produce a video news report similar to Primetime or 20/20 about some social issue that might affect their community.&quot;<BR>
<BR>
LeeFM says, &quot;Indeed, I like to think that even kids who are not &quot;English class stars&quot; have great power of expression.&quot;<BR>
<BR>
BJB [HelpDesk] nods to Lee.  Let's not forget the arts as a powerful form of communication.<BR>
<BR>
KarenSN [WebCT] asks, &quot;How about a Reader's Theatre?;<BR>
<BR>
KarenSN [WebCT] asks, &quot;A rap?&quot;<BR>
<BR>
LeeFM says, &quot;Absolutely.  I have a particular belief in the untapped power of theater/improv.&quot;<BR>

<h2>[4] Technology Tips</h2>

<i>Participating in the Summer Carnival Pet Show</i><BR>
If you've never created a virtual pet at TAPPED IN, now's the time to give it a try!  When you get a pet from supplies you can type:  /help nameofpet to find out more about that pet and what you can do.  You can also take a look at the pet tutorial, Hole in One in the After School Online room and get the archived dialogues of virtual critters from the ASO emailer. (2000/08/11 Virtual Pets, 1999/10/14 Classroom Critters, The Virtual Pet Show [Summer Carnival 99])  The Pet Show will be a time to show off your creations or learn how to make a pet of your own!<BR>
<BR>

<i>Advanced Tech Tip of the Month: HelpDesk Volunteers</i><BR>
Do you remember the first time you logged in to TAPPED IN?  Entering the TAPPED IN environment can sometimes be an intimidating experience for even the most advanced web user.  Were you welcomed by a HelpDesk volunteer?  You can be the person who helps a new member or guest feel comfortable by joining the HelpDesk team and volunteering for as little as one hour a week.  Training, mentoring and continued support are provided.  See our HelpDesk page for more information.<BR>
