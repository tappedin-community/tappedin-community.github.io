Quote of the Month - &quot;If out of the tragic events of [September 11] the world can find a renewed will to co-operate in finding just solutions to the problems that threaten the safety, security and well-being of us all, the highest tribute would have been paid to those who lost their lives.&quot; - Nobel Peace Laureates, Nelson R Mandela F W de Klerk D M Tutu, South Africa, 19 September 2001 (See <a href="http://www.thecommunity.com/crisis/">http://www.thecommunity.com/crisis/</a>)

Debra's Perspective<BR>
<BR>
I was first introduced to TAPPED IN several years ago by Dr. Chris Dede.  We were co-teaching an Emerging Technologies course and arranged for the students to attend the Summer Carnival where he was giving a talk.  The students enjoyed talking to other people and interacting with the environment.  From that moment on I was hooked and knew I had to find ways to include TAPPED IN into my courses.<BR>
<BR>
I attended one of the Tips and Tour sessions that are offered weekly.  BJ showed me how to move around and how to talk to other people.  That day I established my virtual office.  I taught an online course and held virtual office hours on Saturday mornings.  I loved the idea of having office hours in my pajamas, drinking coffee.  I also liked the recorder which recorded my conversations with the students and then e-mailed me the transcript.  What a great feature!<BR>
<BR>
I had small groups of students meet with me in TAPPED IN and began showing them what they could do in this environment.  I remember one student who was having trouble grasping the concept of virtual interactions.  It took me awhile to get her to understand that she had to use her imagination.  By the end of the session she had cooked a virtual pizza and was sharing it with her group members.  She came so far in such a short time, thanks to the easy-to-use interface provided by TAPPED IN.<BR>

<h2>[6] Technology Tips</h2>

<i>Judging a book by its cover</i><BR>
So often in our busy schedules we dash to our computers, log into TAPPED IN, get involved in a discussion, and forget what resources, FAQ's and links are available to the members and guests.  One place worthy of a second and third look is back on the TAPPED IN homepage. Take some time to examine this often over-looked page.<BR>
<BR>
<i>Advanced Tech Tip of the Month: HelpDesk Volunteers</i><BR>
TAPPED IN membership has passed 14,000! That's the good news. The bad news is that this means we need HelpDesk Volunteers more than ever.  All volunteers are teamed with a mentor.  The volunteers chose the amount of time they can commit. If you can contribute one hour a week or an hour a month we'd love to hear from you.  For more information, contact BJ at bjb @ tappedin.org.
