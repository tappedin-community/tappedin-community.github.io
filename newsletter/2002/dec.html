Quote of the Month -<BR>
Time present and time past<BR>
Are both perhaps present in time future,<BR>
And time future contained in time past.<BR>
If all time is eternally present<BR>
All time is unredeemable.<BR>
- T.S. (Thomas Stearns) Eliot

<h2>[1] Time Past, Present, & Future - A New Year's Resolution</h2>

Time is all about taking "ownership" and valuing each unredeemable moment. Educators face a challenging future. As a valued member of the TAPPED IN Community, you have already made a commitment to taking ownership for your professional development by participating regularly in the TAPPED IN After School Online events, attending classes, meeting colleagues, and bringing students to the Student Activities Center. The TAPPED IN staff and volunteers have resolved to provide the Community with exemplary professional development opportunities in 2003. Working together, the future looks very exciting, indeed!

<h2>[2] Member Perspective: Kathleen Bacer</h2>

Kathleen Fletcher Bacer (KathleenDB) is an associate professor and the creator and director of Azusa Pacific University's new <a href="http://www.apu.edu/edtech/online">Master of Arts in Educational Technology Online degree program</a> which will make its debut February 2003 just in time to utilize the new TAPPED IN interface (currently known as TAPPED IN 2). Coming from 19 years of K-8 classroom teaching, and 9 years training teachers in classroom management and manipulative math techniques, Kathleen now trains teachers how to utilize technology in the classroom to impact the teaching/learning process. She has been with APU full time for 5 years where she directed the regional-based MA in Ed Tech program. She earned her masters in education with an emphasis in mathematics from Cal Poly, Pomona, CA and her doctorate in educational technology from Pepperdine University in 1999.<BR><BR>

<i>Kathleen's Perspective</i><BR><BR>
It was through my doctoral work at Pepperdine that I first fell in love with MOOs. Linda Polin introduced me to ElMundo - Pepperdine's Moo at the time - and I was hooked. It was a wonderful way to creatively express myself online and ElMundo still holds a dear space in my virtual persona today. A year after I completed my doctorate I noticed ElMundo was seeming a bit disserted.  Where had everyone gone? I was told by a colleague that they had moved to TAPPED IN, the latest and greatest. I soon discovered that it was indeed just that!<BR><BR>

<h2>[3] Technology Tips</h2>

<i>Hold the SPAM, please!</i><BR>
One of the top priorities of TAPPED IN is to protect the community members from SPAM -"junk mail" - that shows up in your email box from unwanted sources. Folks who send SPAM often create software robots ("web-bots") that visit web sites and harvest email addresses from them, looking especially for addresses in an HTML "mailto" link. For more information, see <a href="http://spam.abuse.net/">http://spam.abuse.net/</a>.  Anti-SPAM measures  taken by TAPPED IN include allowing only mailing list members to submit messages to TAPPED IN mailing lists (like MeetMe). Unlike posting to general Newsgroups, it's very unlikely you will be added to anyone's junk mail list as a result of posting to a TAPPED IN mailing list!<BR><BR>

<i>Advanced Tech Tip of the Month: Your Community Needs You!</i><BR>
TAPPED IN members include many experienced educators who have much to share with the TAPPED IN Community. If you have a suggestion for an After School Online topic and wish to become an After School Online Community Discussion Leader, just fill out the form at http://www.tappedin.org/info/surveys/asoprop.html. A TAPPED IN representative will provide support and help facilitate your discussions.
