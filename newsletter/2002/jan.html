Quote of the Month - &quot;The source of genius is imagination alone, the refinement of the senses that sees what others do not see, or sees them differently.&quot; - Eugene Delacroix

<h2>[1] Member Perspective: Kimberly Flack</h2>

<i>Kim's Perspective</i><BR>
<BR>
&quot;Hi, welcome to TAPPED IN. Can I help you with anything?&quot;  The words on the screen spoke softly to me, and sounded in my ears like a clerk as I first enter a store to shop.  I wasn't sure whether to click the X in the top of my screen quickly and run. I couldn't do this.  Teenagers did chats, people on talk shows did chats, but teachers?  I just didn't know.  This was unfamiliar territory.<BR>
<BR>
I found myself typing back.  &quot;Hi, I'm here for the Crazy 8s Summer Carnival.&quot;  My response suddenly went from my typing area to the conversation above.  I had entered cyberland, chatzone, TAPPED IN and there was no turning back.  Suddenly people smiled, waved, nodded.  The chat screen became alive with human interaction and a voice directed me to the appropriate location and said I could follow someone.<BR>
<BR>
With a simple keystroke accompanying the word follow (/follow) I was able to attach myself to another educator and begin the conference. I was fascinated with the whole process.<BR>

<h2>[2] New! Member Resources Web Pages</h2>

We are developing a new section of the TAPPED IN web site: a place where community leaders can share their own personal resources for educators, their favorite sites related to their area(s) of expertise, and After School Online (ASO) sessions they lead at TAPPED IN. The new web page is at http://www.tappedin.org/info/members.html. Check out the members we have listed there already - you may find some wonderful resources and learn more about the TAPPED IN community leaders too!  If you lead an ASO discussion group and are interested in contributing resources and a little background information about yourself to share with the TAPPED IN community, please email us. We will work with you to create a Member Resource web page.

<h2>[5] AAUW Community Action Grants: by Laura Reasoner Jones</h2>

I am a recipient of a Community Action Grants from the AAUW (American Association of University Women) Educational Foundation. My partners and I are using the AAUW Research Report: Tech-Savvy Girls: Educating Girls in the New Computer Age, to create a video to use with parents, teachers, counselors and AAUW groups. This video will highlight the report's findings that girls know they can be involved in technology, but that they don't want to. We also will provide a user's guide with resources for the video viewers to help the girls they care about. <BR>
<BR>
I am a Teacher-in-Residence at the National Board for Professional Teaching Standards, working on a project to show accomplished teaching while integrating technology into the curriculum. I know that the concerns brought out in the AAUW report (poor teacher training, uninviting computer culture, violent content of most games, etc.,) are real and girls are turning away from IT classes and professions in large numbers. Not only are they doing themselves a disservice in economic terms, the whole computer industry is losing out by girls' non-participation.<BR>
<BR>
As a follow-up to last month's ...On the TAPIS note about the grants from AAUW, I would highly recommend that teachers apply if interested in making changes for girls and women in your community. (The deadline for applications is postmark January 15. For more information call 800-326-2289, email: info@aauw.org or visit <a href="http://www.aauw.org/fga/fellowships_grants/community_action.cfm">http://www.aauw.org/fga/fellowships_grants/community_action.cfm</a>.
