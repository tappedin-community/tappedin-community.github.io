<BR>
Quote of the Month - &quot;All great masters are chiefly distinguished by the power of adding a second, a third, and perhaps a fourth step in a continuous line. Many a man had taken the first step. With every additional step you enhance immensely the value of your first.&quot; - Ralph Waldo Emerson

<h2>[1] Summer Carnival 2002: Online Learning</h2>

An online cooking class brought to you by a team of Webheads, science discussions led by Jan Naher, a session with Gail Hoskins from Eisenhower National Clearinghouse, and a University Symposium on Online Learning are just a few of the fun and exciting events planned for the Summer Carnival on July 17.<BR>
<BR>
The University Symposium has started a dialogue with an asynch discussion at the TAPPED IN University email group. The email group is a place to introduce relevant topics and discuss the different requirements for successful Online Learning courses. The dialogue will conclude with a real time discussion at the Carnival Symposium.

<h2>[2] Member Perspective: Tim Smith</h2>

Tim has a split personality. He currently works for the Collaborative for Teaching and Learning in Louisville, Kentucky and The Galef Institute in Los Angeles, California. At the Collaborative, Tim coordinates technology issues with programs related to teacher professional development and student learning. He also works as a technology/media coach for The Galef Institute in a middle grades research project issued by the US Department of Education. Tim is also a doctoral student focusing on educational technology at Pepperdine University.<BR>
<BR>
<i>Tim's Perspective</i><BR>
<BR>
Many educators see technology as the silver bullet for reforming the way students learn in the classroom. Many districts purchase state of the art computer labs, classroom workstations and media studios with the hope that student learning will increase as a result of all of this "stuff". Many researchers are finding that the "if we build it they will come" implementation of educational technology does not hold water. In my experience, access to innovative learning tools is part of the solution but the real improvement in student learning comes from a change in teacher practice. Technology only serves as a tool in this process.<BR>

<h2>[3] Online Learning or Learning Online?</h2>

Dianne Allen's enthusiasm for all she does is contagious and her sense of humor makes even the smallest tasks fun. When Dianne learned that the theme of the TAPPED IN Summer Carnival was OnLine Learning, she quipped that the acronym for On Line Learning is OLL. Her wit quickly changed the theme title to Learning On Line: LOL :-) Dianne is organizing the group of volunteers who will greet Carnival participants and make sure they get to the correct event. If you are ready to smile often, compete for a &quot;helpdesk volunteer award&quot;, and have fun while supporting the TAPPED IN community, contact Dianne at dlallen@ozemail.com.au and let her know you want to be a part of LOL.

<h2>[4] Networking to the Max</h2>

TAPPED IN depends on networking to let members know what is happening in the community. Organizations that hold online sessions in TAPPED IN also use networking to publicize TAPPED IN events by using their own listserv and print formats. Kathy Honda, Education Coordinator at PBS, shared her thoughts about an upcoming Social Studies Forum discussion on the PBS series &quot;The Rise and Fall of Jim Crow&quot; with this comment to the PBS listserv, &quot;This is a great opportunity for our huge community to virtually &quot;get together.&quot; We're especially interested in feedback about the [Jim Crow] site, and your suggestions on where we should go with the development of materials.&quot; If your organization is hosting a discussion at TAPPED IN, contact us and we can help you include information that will make it easy for your members to participate in the event.

<h2>[5] Technology Tips</h2>

<i>Networking with mail groups</i><BR>
TAPPED IN has several email Special Interest Groups (SIGs). Email groups are a great way to keep current on the events scheduled on the calendar. The weekly TAPPED IN Calendar is posted to the MEET ME mail group. You can also use an email group like MEET ME to share information or seek others with interests similar to yours or arrange collaboration with a class or organization.

<i>Advanced Tech Tip of the Month: HelpDesk Volunteer</i><BR>
You've participated in several discussion groups, taken the grand tour of TAPPED IN (Tours and Tips), and now feel pretty comfortable getting around. You're a pro! Now, think back on how intimidated you felt when you first logged in and were greeted by someone on the helpdesk. By volunteering for just one hour a week you can be a member of the HelpDesk team and pass on a warm welcome to that next newbie that enters the TAPPED IN front door.

<h2>[6] TAPPED IN News Nugget</h2>

This special nugget is dedicated to all the frazzled end-of-the-year, toasty around the edges, teachers. Marshall and Evan are the webmaster and headmaster of <a href="http://www.Out2Teach.com">Out2Teach.com</a>. The following is their introduction from the Out2Teach web page. Sometimes it's best to just get out of the way and let the experts do their thing!<BR>
<BR>
Evan, Headmaster: Allow me to introduce myself! My name is Evan, and I am a high school student, eager to give back to the education community that has taught me so much. A few years ago I found it was evident that technology is present in most schools, but is not being used to its fullest potential - approaching learning in a new light. After noticing that flaw, I decided to create <a href="http://www.Out2Teach.com">Out2Teach.com</a>, an online community dedicated to helping teachers integrate technology into everyday learning. It is my job to manage the content on <a href="http://www.Out2Teach.com">Out2Teach.com</a> as well as everything except the site design. Marshall and I have been designing web sites together since 3rd grade, so we each found our strengths and built up from there. Please enjoy your visit and feel free to pass your comments on.  I can be reached at evan@out2teach.com.<BR>
<BR>
Marshall, Webmaster: Like Evan, I'm a high school student. I've been making web sites for a couple of years now, but I have to say that this is the one I'm most proud of. This is the first site that I know will give back to the people who give me so much. I'm in charge of designing and maintaining the site and its backend. If you find a problem with the site, I can be reached at webmaster@out2teach.com and if you just want to chat, marshall@out2teach.com.<BR>
<BR>
<a href="http://www.Out2Teach.com">Out2Teach.com</a> has added the weekly TAPPED IN Calendar to the homepage (check the left hand column). If you see Evan or Marshall logged in, please thank them for a job well done!
