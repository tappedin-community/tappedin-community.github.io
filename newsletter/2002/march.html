Quote of the Month - &quot;A man can only attain knowledge with the help of those who possess it. This must be understood from the very beginning. One must learn from him who knows.&quot; - George Gurdjieff

<h2>[1] Member Perspective: Shunichiro Ito</h2>

Shunichiro Ito, known as Shun or ShunI, teaches business communications and Internet English at Bunkyo Women’s College, Tokyo, Japan. His current interest is further refining his syllabus for his EFL course based on web exploration projects and computer mediated communication activities. In the long term, he wants to show to EFL teachers in Japan how Internet and CMC resources may be used to provide excellent learning facilities otherwise unavailable in classroom environment.<BR>

<i>Shun's Perspective</i><BR>
<BR>
Sometime ago I wrote an email in response to a request from a certain foundation.  The foundation was asking what I actually do using technology in my EFL classes of Japanese college girls.  In return for my cooperation, the director sent me a video titled, &quot;Learn and Live&quot; promoting use of technology in education. I learned then what the George Lucas Educational Foundation was doing for teachers. Kids in the video all had their eyes gleaming with interest.<BR>
<BR>
For awhile I had been trying to find teachers or groups of students to meet with my students at TAPPED IN for discussion. Our class hours were so different that I had found none. Then BJ Berquist's suggestion to meet with the WebHeads discussion group led to a breakthrough.  For the first time in their life, the girls were interactively communicating online with Vance Stevens in Abu Dhabi, UAR, and Dan Bilitz in Wisconsin. <BR>

<h2>[4] Technology Tips</h2>

<i>Participating in an After School Online (ASO) Conversation</i><BR>
If you've never participated in one of the events shown on the Calendar, but want to give it a try, it's as easy as 1,2,3. 1) Log in and ask one of the HelpDesk personnel in Reception to direct you to the meeting room. 2) Click on DETACH to make your text window larger so you can follow the scrolling text. 3) Relax and enjoy! The discussion leader may ask you to introduce yourself. It's up to you how much you want to contribute to the discussion. To see what an online discussion looks like take a look at http://www.tappedin.org/info/chat/ For more conversation tips see, http://www.tappedin.org/info/conversation_tips.html.<BR>

<i>Advanced Tech Tip of the Month: Search the Member Directory</i><BR>
Professors and tech trainers often bring in classes to learn about TAPPED IN. Many times, the classes are required to participate in an ASO discussion. If the individuals are not familiar with ASO netiquette, and have no interest in a particular ASO topic that happens to conveniently coincide with the training time, the participants can feel frustrated and overwhelmed. To help your groups have a constructively positive experience in TAPPED IN, read the Tips for Trainings page at http://www.tappedin.org/info/trainingtips.html.
