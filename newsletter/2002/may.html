Quote of the Month - &quot;Physicists and astronomers see their own implications in the world being round, but to me it means that only one-third of the world is asleep at any given time and the other two-thirds is up to something.&quot; - Dean Rusk

<h2>[1] Around the World with TAPPED IN</h2>

MarkPC says, &quot;[The Social Studies Forum] is a great idea.  I have actually been on the NYTimes education forum, but the response time is usually a couple of hours instead of seconds.&quot;<BR>
<BR>
Louise [guest] [to MarkPC]: &quot;Wow.  I didn't even know that the NYTimes had an education forum.  But you're right, this immediate response is pretty cool.&quot;<BR>
<BR>
[Louise Maxwell, from A&E and the History Channel, was Michael Hutchinson's guest host for the May 8th SSForum.]<BR>
<BR>
Immediate feedback is just one of the features of a real time discussion held in TAPPED IN. The above conversation took place before a public event that was posted on the calendar, but similar comments are heard frequently from other discussion groups and classes. Dianne Allen, a community leader in TAPPED IN, is interested in starting a discussion group for Aussie/NZ/Western Pacific Rim members. Because Dianne, who is located in Australia, understands the global time zone conflict and the universal desire for real time immediate response she would like to establish a group in TAPPED IN that is interested in networking at a "down under" time. If you are interested in joining Dianne's group, contact her at dlallen@ozemail.com.au. And, if you are interested in starting a group in your part of the world, post a message to the MEET ME mail list or contact us.

<h2>[2] Member Perspective: David Weksler</h2>

David Weksler's introduction to TAPPED IN began in 1996, when he managed to get past the front desk at SRI in Menlo Park, CA and found himself sitting at Mark Schlager's desk (Mark is the Director of TAPPED IN). David leads the K-12 Math discussion group twice a month.<BR>

<i>David's Perspective</i><BR>
<BR>
It's Mother's Day, 2002, I'm at my sister's house in Pennsylvania and my folks are also here visiting. My brother-in-law has set the table with a huge variety of breakfast goodies.<BR>
<BR>
I'm rushing to log into TAPPED IN this Sunday morning. I'm looking forward to "see" who has shown up for the Sunday morning "Webheads" group at TAPPED IN. This group is composed of an international group of English as Second Language instructors and researchers and although I lead a math discussion in TAPPED IN, I so enjoy the dynamics of this group that I don't mind being out of the loop.<BR>
<BR>
Before I can even type &quot;hello&quot;, I've been greeted by 6 or more people who have gotten online earlier: they are in Pennsylvania, Spain, Germany, Abu Dhabi, Detroit, France, Argentina (it goes on). It's amazing. While I'm helping make breakfast (not really helping very much), I'm also chatting with this International group of ESL educators. It's AMAZING!<BR>

<h2>[5] Technology Tips</h2>

<i>Using Whiteboards</i><BR>
Whiteboards can be found in most rooms in TAPPED IN. They can be useful for structuring a discussion. The discussion leader may have an agenda that she wants to cover during a meeting. Posting to the whiteboard keeps everyone on task as the information can be easily referred to as the discussion progresses. To post text to the whiteboard, click on WHITEBOARD on the room drawing and scroll down on the whiteboard to the text input window. When you have entered your text, click on the WRITE ON WHITEBOARD button. If more than one person is entering text on the whiteboard, scroll below the whiteboard text input window and click on RELOAD to see what they have written. (Be careful - those cute little erasers really work!)
<BR><BR>
<i>Advanced Tech Tip of the Month: Entering whiteboard text into a transcript</i><BR>
The entries on the whiteboard may be important points that have been made during a discussion. Because it is very easy to erase the contents of the whiteboard, and the whiteboard text is not captured as part of the transcript, it's a good idea to save the whiteboard text. You can do this by clicking on PRINT TO NOTE under the whiteboard text input window. This converts the text to a note. Scroll down to the bottom of the note and click on PROJECT to enter the whiteboard text into the transcript as a permanent record.
