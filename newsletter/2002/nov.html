Quote of the Month - &quot;Gratitude is when memory is stored in the heart and not in the mind.&quot; - Lionel Hampton

<h2>[1] Don't read this... - by BJ Berquist</h2>

Yikes, it's that time of year again... Don't read this if you have never spoken to a newbie in TAPPED IN (or been a newbie yourself).  Don't read this if you have never participated in an After School Online TAPPED IN event.  Don't read this if you have never received an email with information about coming events in TAPPED IN.  Don't read this if you've never been helped by one of the TAPPED IN Helpdesk Volunteers.  And, most of all, don't read this if you have never been a member or guest of the TAPPED IN Community of Practice.<BR><BR>

You're still here? Good! Before we all become overwhelmed with obligations and responsibilities during the busy holiday season, please take a moment to think about those memories stored in your heart that Lionel Hampton refers to in the quote of the month.  I have often been asked what I feel is the most important feature of TAPPED IN, and I always reply, without hesitation, that it is the PEOPLE.  This includes the staff who provide the environment we have come to love (and who are preparing the exciting new interface that will be introduced after the first of the year), and the discussion leaders who volunteer their time to bring the best practices in education to our community.  It also includes the volunteers who sit at the helpdesk calming the fears of the newbies who enter TAPPED IN and answering questions from guests and members, and of course it also includes the members who selflessly take the time to offer advice and guidance to guests.  I don't know about you, but my heart is overflowing with gratitude - from the TAPPED IN Staff - thank you all!

<h2>[2] Member Perspective: Aiden Yeh</h2>

Aiden Yeh (AidenY) teaches EFL in Shih Chien University and National Kaoshiung First University of Science and Technology.  He received his MS degree in ELT (English Language Teaching) Management from the University of Surrey and TESOL Certificate from University of Leicester.  He is an active member of TESOL and IATEFL and a die-hard Webhead. (Webheads is an online community of students and teachers who have been communicating and interacting since 1989.)<BR><BR>

<i>Aiden's Perspective</i><BR><BR>
I cannot remember exactly the first time I visited TAPPED IN. However, I am pretty sure that it was Vance Stevens (the man behind Webheads) who introduced me to TAPPED IN. At that time, both Vance and I were moderating our own respective EV online sessions (see <a href="http://groups.yahoo.com/groups/evonline">http://groups.yahoo.com/groups/evonline</a>). I joined Vance's session, "Webheads in Action: Community formation online and its role in language learning" (see <a href="http://groups.yahoo.com/group/evonline2002_webheads"> http://groups.yahoo.com/group/evonline2002_webheads</a>) and I was hooked right away, not only to the use of technology, but also the people that make the community alive and vibrant. Webheads meet regularly online every Sunday, 12 noon GMT and these meetings are held at TAPPED IN.  It was at one of those special meetings with the other Webheads when I got to learn more about TAPPED IN and meet the people behind the helpdesk (BJ, KeikoS, and SusanneN) who were/are always there for newbies like me. <BR><BR>

<h2>[3] Technology Tips</h2>

<i>Sense of Place</i><BR>
The TAPPED IN virtual environment is more than just bits and bytes on a computer program.  Transition from the real world to the virtual world is facilitated by the "sense of place" that is prevalent in the TAPPED IN environment.  This month's tech tip is actually a non-tech tip...forget the tech and think about the place: the buildings, the rooms, and the people that occupy the space.  When you approach TAPPED IN this way, the transition is a snap!<BR><BR>

<i>Advanced Tech Tip of the Month: Staff Development Training Tips</i><BR>
Whether you are leading a staff development training session, or bringing a class of college or graduate students online, these tips may be helpful for you in introducing TAPPED IN. See www.tappedin.org/info/trainingtips.html.
