<h2>[1]Profile of a TAPPED IN Member - by BJ Berquist</h2>

Welcome to TAPPED IN! Are you here to join a discussion group or are you here to meet with a class?  Oh, this is your first visit to the TAPPED IN environment! We're so glad you could take the time to visit and see all the resources that are available :-). One of the most valuable resources of TAPPED IN is its international membership of over 15,000. How do you know if you qualify for membership? Good question! All of the members are involved in education in some way...researchers, edtech leaders and coordinators, librarians, K-12 teachers and students, university students, pre-service teachers, professors, ESL/EFL teachers, and more!  The calendar of events reflects not only the diverse interests of the membership, but also the mutual love of learning and the desire to share knowledge with others. If you think you fit that profile, the answer to your question about whether you qualify for membership is a resounding yes!

<h2>[2] Member Perspective: Derrel Fincher</h2>

Derrel (Derrelf) spent fifteen years in engineering prior to becoming a teacher in 1998. He switched careers when he found himself in front of a class of sixth grade math students for nine weeks in 1997 and realized he liked it!  Now with certifications in K-12 Mathematics and Elementary Education he is a Math and Technology teacher at the American School in Japan.  He discovered TAPPED IN when it was a requirement for his coursework in Pepperdine University's Online Master of Arts in Educational Technology (OMAET) program but he found it so useful he now uses it with his middle school students as well as using it for discussions with other professionals.<BR>
<BR>
<i>Derrel's Perspective</i><BR>
<BR>
The most significant learning for individuals occurs within a social context, whether it's an engineering team trying to create a new product or authors discussing writing.  I try to give my students the same experience of learning within a social context I enjoyed as an engineer. <BR>

<h2>[3] Ken Burns Visits TAPPED IN!</h2>

Ken Burns has been making documentary films for more than twenty years.  Since the Academy Award-nominated Brooklyn Bridge in 1981, he has gone on to direct and produce some of the most acclaimed historical documentaries ever made, including The Civil War (1990) and Baseball (1994). The historian Stephen Ambrose has said of Ken's films, "More Americans get their history from Ken Burns than any other source."  Ken joined Michael Hutchison, Social Studies Forum discussion leader, for a special Social Studies Forum at TAPPED IN on September 12 and spent an hour answering questions from the discussion participants. The transcript from the event will be posted soon on the Social Studies Forum mail list.<BR>

<h2>[5] Technology Tips</h2>

<i>Student Activity Center</i><BR>
If you teach a class of K-12 students, you can have them log into the TAPPED IN Student Activities Center (SAC) to meet with a class from another school, talk with an author or an expert, or engage in jigsaw activities in the Studios. 
<BR><BR>
<i>Advanced Tech Tip of the Month: Getting Student Accounts</i><BR>
If you want to bring your class to the SAC, you will need to get student accounts for them.  A student account provides a private, safe and secure opportunity for the student to log in to the SAC.
