Quote of the Month - "A world community can exist only with world communication, which means something more than extensive shortwave facilities scattered about the globe. It means common understanding, a common tradition, common ideas, and common ideals." - Robert M. Hutchins (1899-1977) US educator, writer

<h2>[1] Mooooooving to TI2</h2>

As most of you have already heard, TAPPED IN has created a new improved system (dubbed TI2) that has many additional features built into it, such as group management, file sharing, threaded discussion boards, search, membership and place directories, and instant messaging. More features are coming! More and more After School Online (ASO) sessions, groups, and organizations are moving over to TI2. Don't get left behind! Get your new account for TI2 today! To get an account for TI2, go to <a href="/tappedin/">the Tapped In home page</a> and click on "Sign up". Your regular TAPPED IN username and password will not work in the new system. If you have any questions or comments about the new system, email us.

<h2>[2] Member Perspective: Jill Thomas</h2>

Jill Thomas is the Technology Coordinator for Sesser-Valier School District in Sesser, Illinois, a small rural district that includes Kindergarten through 12th grade.<BR><BR>
<i>Jill's Perspective</i><BR><BR>
I use TAPPED IN for our Regional Office of Education. We wrote a Federal Challenge Grant 4 years ago. It was funded for 5 years. In a nutshell, our goal was to increase professional development, engaged learning teaching strategies, and the Illinois Learning Standards. We were looking for innovative ways to teach and learn and we felt that TAPPED IN gave us that avenue.<BR><BR>
See all our member perspectives.

<h2>[3] April is National Volunteer Recognition Month</h2>

The next time you read the calendar and log in for an After School Online (ASO) event please take a moment to thank the people who provide these events and help you participate in the discussions. If you ever doubt that the spirit of volunteerism is alive and well, stop and think of the countless hours that the TAPPED IN volunteers and ASO discussion leaders contribute to the community!

<h2>[6] Free SimForest Simulator Software for Inquiry Learning</h2>

The SimForest project has developed a simulation-based software prototype and associated curriculum materials to support inquiry learning in biology and ecology classes for grades 7-12 and college level. Students can plant trees from a pool of over 30 regional species, set environmental parameters such as rain fall, temperature, and soil conditions, and watch the forest plot grow and evolve over many years. A forest plot's sensitivity to natural and man-made disturbances can be evaluated, and emergent properties such as species succession can be observed. Graphing and analysis tools are provided to make inquiry more efficient. The software prototype and materials are at <a href="http://ddc.hampshire.edu/simforest/">http://ddc.hampshire.edu/simforest/</a>.  The software is offered free of charge without support or any guarantees. Feedback is appreciated from users. For more information, contact: Tom Murray, Sr. Research Fellow Adjunct Associate Prof. of Instructional Technology School of Cognitive Science, Hampshire College (413) 559-5433 tmurray@hampshire.edu See <a href="http://helios.hampshire.edu/~tjmCCS/">http://helios.hampshire.edu/~tjmCCS/</a>

<h2>[7] GLOBE/Operation RubyThroat Workshops</h2>

Operation RubyThroat, administered by Hilton Pond Center for Piedmont Natural History, is the first Web-based GLOBE protocol that involves animal behavior observations. Bill Hilton Jr., as a principal investigator, is now authorized to train teachers in GLOBE hummingbird protocols and to designate those educators' schools as GLOBE sites. By participating in Operation RubyThroat, you and your students will join others from the U.S., Canada, Mexico, and all seven Central American countries as they monitor migration, feeding, and nesting behavior in Ruby-throated Hummingbirds. You can view the GLOBE hummingbird protocols at <a href="http://www.globe.gov">http://www.globe.gov</a> and get info about hummingbirds from the <a href="http://www.rubythroat.org">Operation RubyThroat Web site</a>. See <a href="http://www.hiltonpond.org">http://www.hiltonpond.org</a> for info about Hilton Pond Center. Bill leads the Nuts About Nature discussion at TAPPED IN.
