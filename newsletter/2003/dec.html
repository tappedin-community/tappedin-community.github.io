<i>Mary's Perspective</i><br>
I literally stumbled across Tapped In as I was searching for professional development opportunities for students in my very first online course.  I teach pre-service teacher technology courses at the University of Houston and conduct an online technology integration course for 100 student educators in their first semester of field-based placement.  These students have been introduced to basic technology tools in previous semesters and are in their last semester of coursework before embarking on student teaching.  I feel that this is the perfect time to introduce them to online opportunities for furthering their understanding of the profession that is teaching and how modern technologies can enable them to advantage themselves of resources that might otherwise be unavailable.  Tapped In is the perfect resource for developing this understanding.<br>

<h2>[2] Tips and Comments From the Experts</h2>
This month's column Tips and Comments from the Real Experts: the Members of Tapped In, features members' reflections on and use of Tapped In.<br>
--------------------<br>
Lynne Wolters reports that, in a magazine article review that mentioned Tapped In, an undergrad student from Concordia University, College of Education, Portland, OR explains TI2 as "a chat room on steroids."<br>
--------------------<br>
Debra Sprague, discussion leader for the monthly Publishing Your Work, logged in to Tapped In to let whoever was on duty know she was bringing in a large group.  In a follow-up email she commented, "I think it is professional courtesy to let the Help Desk know that so they know what to expect.  The people in the workshop enjoyed Tapped In."<br>

<h2>[3] Tapped In Technology Tip</h2>
<i>Bringing K-12 Students to the Student Activity Center</i><br>
Since the opening of the K-12 Student Activity Center (SAC) there are now 40 groups and almost 1000 student accounts! Setting up a group room in the SAC is easy and can be done through the Tapped In tab/Groups/Create a New K-12 Student Group. Setting up the accounts for your students is included in the group creation process and allows you to designate a password and individual student usernames. The SAC environment and the Student Accounts are designed to provide the most secure setting for you, your students and the Tapped In Community. Read <a href="/tappedin/web/help/faq.jsp#studentstopic ">more about student accounts</a> and be sure to read our <a href="/tappedin/web/help/students.jsp">Terms for Bringing K-12 Students Online</a>.

<h2>[4] We have met the professionals and they are us!</h2>
As Tapped In approaches an international membership of 10,000, and because helpdesk volunteers and administrators can't always be online, the burden of monitoring behavior and maintaining the exceptional professional standards we have all come to expect from all Tapped In users within the community falls on the community members. If you experience any guest or member who is rude or inappropriate, please take a few steps to ensure that this person knows that Tapped In is a place for educators and that only professional behavior will be accepted. Then follow through by identifying the guest or member and relaying the information to Tapped In administration.<br>
<br>
To identify a guest, first highlight their name under the ONLINE tab to the left of the chat window. Then go to the Actions drop down menu in the top right of the chat window and scroll down to Show Login Info. Once this information has been entered in your chat window, go back to the Actions menu and send your chat to the pasteboard. Highlight the login information and any of the transcript text that includes the inappropriate behavior, copy and then paste to an email to <a href="http://tappedin.org/contact">http://tappedin.org/contact</a>. Once you have done this, if the guest is still logged in, type /ignore nameofguest. This will prevent you from seeing any text that the guest sends.<br>
<br>
If the offending person is a member, please remind them that Tapped In has a <a href="/tappedin/web/help/conduct.jsp">Code of Professional Conduct</a>. If rude behavior continues, send the username and a copy of the offensive chat text to <a href="http://tappedin.org/contact">http://tappedin.org/contact</a>. You can use the /ignore command to block any additional messages from this member.

<h2>[6] Pre-service Science Teachers Research Internship</h2>
The National Renewable Energy Laboratory (NREL) and the Department of Energy have a program for pre-service science teachers to participate in a 10-week science research internship at NREL in Golden, Colorado over the summer. This is a paid internship with many other perks and allowances. This opportunity is available to any teacher candidates that may be interested in participating in this exciting program (pre-service science, math, and technology teachers are eligible as undergraduate or graduate students).
