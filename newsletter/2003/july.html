<h2>[1] Don't miss the 2003 Tapped In 2 Launch Festival!</h2>
Come celebrate the new version of Tapped In by joining with colleagues and friends
during a fun filled day of collaboration in teaching and learning during the
Tapped In 2 Launch Festival on July 16. The schedule, which includes some old
favorites as well as some new special events, starts at 6am PDT/9am EDT with
The Early Bird Gets the Worm (at ENC Online) and continues non-stop to Collaborative
Internet Tools & Sites at 8pm PDT/11pm EDT. 

Certificates of Participation will be offered for everyone who registers for and
attends three Festival events. These certificates may be submitted to your school
district for continuing education credits (Acceptance of the Certificates for
Continuing Ed Credits is determined by individual school districts.)

<h2>[2] Member Perspective: Gail Hoskins</h2>
Gail Hoskins is Senior Outreach Coordinator at the Eisenhower National Clearinghouse
(ENC) in Columbus OH.  A K-12 math and science teacher center, ENC is funded by
the U.S. Department of Education and produces free print and CD-ROM professional
development resources.  <a href="http://www.enc.org">ENC Online</a> offers almost
24,000 catalog records of K-12 math and science curriculum resources and it logs
1.8 million page views per month. ENC has 125,000 subscribers to its (free) print
ENC Focus.

<i>Gail's Perspective</i><br>
<br>
I became a member of Tapped In on July 22, 1997. (I still have that email - mentioning
Mark and Patti - and notice that Tapped In did not yet have its own domain then!).
I did my first online presentation for Tapped In on February 23, 1999, and, as is
my custom at each event I do, provided a web page summary. That is still online
at <a href="http://www.enc.org/training/tappedin.htm">http://www.enc.org/training/tappedin.htm</a>
(Caution: just like Tapped In has changed and improved and reinvented itself several
times, so has ENC. The links from that page to ENC go to the ENC Online of three
iterations ago!) While some members become quite involved in all aspects of
TAPPED IN, my use of it has been as a tool for conducting online presentations
or training.

<h2>[3] Yadda, yadda, yadda...</h2>
Because the information from the "experts" often goes in one ear and out the other,
this issue of the Tapis introduces a new column - tips and comments from the Real
Experts: the new members of Tapped In. This month features new members' reflections
on participating in the July 16 TI2 Launch Festival. The quotations are from
students in the Advanced Teaching with Technology class with Course Coordinator,
Bernie Dodge, Ph.D.. The instructors for the class were Wendy Parcel, M.A.; Roberto
DelBusto, M.A.; and Jim Julius, M.A.<br>
--------------------<br>
[The pre-festival tour guides] offered advice on netiquette for the festival or other
discussions. The best piece of advice I received is to listen. Do not interrupt a
discussion leader and wait for them to ask for questions or comments. If you are
attending the festival, I suggest you go to Susan Roseman's discussion about ideas
for a successful first day of school in a kindergarten class. She is very excited
about it and has some great ideas. - Jackie Frazier<br>
--------------------<br>
The Pre Festival Tour was to help those get better prepared for the actual Festival.
I wasn't sure who was going to be participating in this chat, but I was surprised
to find out it was girls I had taken a summer school class with. So right away I
felt comfortable, which was nice. [The pre-festival tour guides] gave some great
tips too, like how to detach so you can read more of the chat room dialogues.
When they showed us that, I was able to follow along better because I read more
of the dialogue. I am definitely going to invest more of my time into this Tapped
In program and do some exploring. It was fun. - Bridget Collet<br>
--------------------<br>
It was nice to be attending [the discussion] from my own home where I was able to
grab a snack half way through the discussion.  The group seemed jovial, thoughtful,
and welcoming Ð and I wasn't expecting to experience this sense of warmth through
the computer. - Wyn Jamieson<br>
--------------------<br>
I found using Tapped In and being involved in discussion groups are a great way to
network, branch out, and share ideas with other teachers or professionals. As a
future teacher, I could use all the help and support I can get. This tool can
connect me to my neighboring teachers in the community as well as those who live
thousands of miles away. It's amazing! - Michelle Pampo<br>

<h2>[4] If 3's a crowd, what's a TI2 Group?</h2>
Kim Griffin reports, "I have created a group for all of my past students over the
years and 26 have signed up in less than a week! Nice way to keep in touch and
do some interesting things. I am the director of the Middlebury College MA program
in Spain. All past students are now high school Spanish teachers, so keeping in
touch from Spain and keeping up with using Spanish is important for them. I have
contacted over 300 of my past students and project that at least 100 will join
the group."<br>

Technology for Learning: No School Left Behind." It examines accountability,
research-based practice and 21st Century Skills. The demands of <i>No Child Left Behind</i>
can stretch schools (and school people) to the breaking point. No one person has
the knowledge, time or talents to tackle all the challenges of learning in a
digital age. <i>Information Technology for Learning</i> shows in concise, practical
language how to connect your human and technology resources for success. See
