Quote of the Month - "Beyond a critical point within a finite space, freedom
diminishes as numbers increase...the human question is not how many can possibly
survive within the system, but what kind of existence is possible for those who
do survive." - Madeleine Albright

<h2>[1] 2003 Tapped In 2 Launch Festival</h2>
The fifth annual Tapped In Summer Carnival has a new look and a new name! Come
celebrate the new version of Tapped In by joining with colleagues and friends
during a fun filled day of collaboration in teaching and learning during the
Tapped In2 Launch Festival on July 16. Planning has begun and the tentative
8am-8pm PDT schedule includes some old favorites as well as some new special
events. Join Gail Hoskins and Tracy Crow, staff at the Eisenhower National
Clearinghouse, for an exciting pre-Festival tour of
<a href="http://www.enc.org">ENC Online</a>.  The Early Bird Gets the Worm (
at ENC Online) from 9:00-10:15am EDT/6:00-7:15am PDT.
<br><br>
Certificates of Participation will be offered for everyone who registers for
and attends three Festival events. These certificates may be submitted to your
school district for continuing education credits (Acceptance of the Certificates
for Continuing Ed Credits is determined individual school districts.) There will
be additional pre-Festival tours of Tapped In 2 to help you get the most from
this exciting day. For more information about the 2003 Tapped In 2 Launch
Festival watch for the July Tapped In 2 Calendar of Events, join the Meet Me
email group or contact BJ Berquist at bjb@tappedin.org. If you are interested
in volunteering for the Festival HelpDesk, contact Dianne Allen at

<h2>[2] Member Perspective: Carolyn Gery</h2>
Carolyn Gery is the Technology Coordinator for Berkeley High School, the main
9-12 campus in Berkeley, California. She coordinates technology funding for the
site as well as works with the K-8 coordinator to create articulated technology
staff development opportunities for the district. She has worked at Berkeley
High for the last 4 years. Before coming to the Bay Area Carolyn was an Assistant
Curriculum Coordinator and Spanish Teacher for 10 years at Kapa'a High School in
Kapa'a, Hawaii. Carolyn is currently an Educational Technology Doctoral student
at Pepperdine University.
<br><br>
<i>Carolyn's Perspective</i>
<br><br>
I was first introduced to distance learning through a one-year teacher technology
development program in Hawaii. The program, T3 or Telecommunications and Technology
for Teachers integrated "live" broadcasted class sessions that connected
participants on all of the islands. At that time newsgroups were a major component
enabling us to stay connected in between class sessions. Chat rooms, although
introduced, were not utilized in the program and were not connected to educational
learning activities.
<br><br>
After moving to Berkeley, I realized that I wanted to pursue educational technology
at the Doctoral Level. I was introduced to Tapped In as I began the program this year.

<h2>[3] Technology Tips</h2>
<i>Using the Search Tab to locate a member's office</i><br>
You have a meeting planned with a colleague in their Tapped In office. You've
logged in a few minutes early and plan to go to the colleague's office to start
working on some notes, but you've forgotten to add the room to your favorites
(see Advanced Tech Tip). To quickly and easily find a Tapped In member's office
once you have logged in, click on the Search tab in the upper right of your screen.
When you click on the Places tab and enter the name of the office owner, and click
on the Find It! button, you should see a door icon next to the name you've entered.
Clicking on the door icon will take you right to that office :-).
<br><br>
<i>Advanced Tech Tip: Add to Favorite Places</i><br>
When you enter a room that is not on your Favorite Places drop down menu, you will
see an "add to my favorites" link to the left of the Favorite Places drop down menu.
When this link is clicked, the room is automatically added to your Favorite Places.
You can go to this room from anywhere in Tapped In by clicking on the room name in
Favorite Places and then Go!
