Quote of the Month - "When was the last time you did something for the first time?" - Airline ad

<h2>[1] Do Something for the First Time - by BJ Berquist</h2>

Although it's pure commercialism, the slogan from the airline ad reminds us, as educators, to take the opportunity to re-examine our daily routines and try something new. When was the last time you had a learning experience filled with excitement and wonder? Too often a new opportunity is looked at as just another burden... another time-consuming item to cram into our busy schedules. While it's not an airplane trip to an exotic country, one exciting and wonderful thing to do for the first time is sign up and log in to the new version of TAPPED IN (dubbed TI2). To help you take advantage of this opportunity and lessen the time it takes to learn about the new features in TI2, Fabulous Friday Tours have been scheduled. Log in to TI2 http://ti2.sri.com. You can view the descriptions for all the March TI2 events on the calendar. (<i>Please note that if you are a member of the "old" TAPPED IN, you must sign up for a new membership. Your "old" TAPPED IN account will not work in TAPPED IN Version 2.</i>)

<h2>[2] Member Perspective: George Warriner</h2>

George is the Coordinator of Instructional Technology for the Sheboygan Area School District in Sheboygan Wisconsin. He has worked in education as a 7-12 math teacher, K-5 math specialist, math resource teacher, technology resource teacher and baseball coach. George is currently a doctoral student at Pepperdine University in the Educational Technology program.<BR>
<BR>
<i>George's Perspective</i><BR>
<BR>
I have been in my position in Sheboygan for about 5 years now. Things were going along pretty well, but I seemed to be losing the edge to my view of technology in education. We were just trying to get things working and make sure the teachers and students were supported with technology as well as possible. When my plan to enroll in the Pepperdine Ed.D. program was approved by the district, I had no idea how immediate and powerful the impact would be.<BR>
<BR>
Now, I had taken on-line courses in the past but I found them to be lacking in urgency and personal relevance. My motivation for these courses quickly waned after the initial excitement. I was uncertain how a doctoral program could sustain my interest when about half of the coursework was conducted on-line. Enter TAPPED IN.<BR>

<h2>[3] NASA Educator Astronaut Program</h2>

<a href="http://edspace.nasa.gov">NASA's Educator Astronaut Program web site</a> is designed to inspire the next generation of explorers. It allows students, parents, friends and colleagues to nominate an educator for NASA's full-time Astronaut Corps, and allows educators to apply for the program. The site promotes proficiency in science, technology, engineering and mathematics, and encourages visitors to work with NASA to shape the future in space and on Earth.
