<h2>[1] Member Perspective: Doug Peterson</h2>
Doug is the Computers in the Classroom Teacher Consultant for the Greater Essex County District School Board in South Western Ontario.  He maintains the GEC Computers in the Classroom website at <a href="http://www.gecdsb.on.ca/d&g/">http://www.gecdsb.on.ca/d&g/</a> and posts a monthly newsletter on the site.  There are lots of goodies online at the GEC site for teachers, including the Webquest Locator.<br>
<br>
Doug has taught Computer Science, Business Applications, Mathematics, and Accounting at the secondary school level.  Now, Doug teaches and supports Greater Essex educators as they work with computers, technology, and students.  Doug has been a speaker at conferences such as those held by the Educational Computing Organization of Ontario, Michigan Association for Computer Users in Learning, and the National Educational Computing Conference.<br>
<br>
<i>Doug's Perspective</i><br>
Using computers is a great deal like being a parent.  Sure, you might take a parenting course through a community service but, for the most part, you parent just like your parents did.  The problem though, is that many of us learned about computers with punched cards, graduated to CRT screens, and mastered JCL.  These are hardly directly applicable to the technology available in the year 2003!<br>
<br>
So, how do you stay on top of things?  The answer is by constantly reading and researching.  The best way to learn about the technology is to use the technology and so I subscribe to and read mailing lists voraciously.  One of the lists that I read regularly is Edtech and like clockwork, there would be these posts about this Tapped In thing.  In the beginning, I figured it just to be some mass advertising of an educational gimmick.  Of curiosity or boredom, I visited the original Tapped In and it was OK, but nothing that overly excited me.  Then, along came Tapped In 2 and the functionality was definitely intriguing.<br>

<h2>[3] Tapped In Technology Tip</h2>
<i>Student Accounts for the Student Center</i><br>
When you create a group room in the Student Center, you will be prompted to complete a form that will generate student accounts. The duration of the accounts can be modified. You will be given auto-generated user names that start with the name you give the group, include numbers from 01 to XX (the size of your group), and end with st (student). Once these accounts have been created, you can go to your student group room /Settings/Member Management to edit the names of each student. All student user names will end in st. Students may then log in as members of Tapped In with the user name you have given them and the password you have chosen.
