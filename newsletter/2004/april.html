Quote of the Month - "We must not, in trying to think about how we can make a big difference, ignore the small daily differences we can make which, over time, add up to big differences that we often cannot foresee." - Marian Wright</p>

<h2>[1] Member Perspective: Marianne Handler</h2>
Marianne Handler is a professor in the Technology in Education Program at National-Louis University. She has been teaching in that program as a full-time faculty member since 1989. Prior to that she was an adjunct in the program while filling her role as Library-Learning Center Director in the Glencoe, Illinois public schools. She was a member of the Glencoe School faculty for twenty-two years before becoming a full-time teacher educator.<br>
<br>
She has co-authored two editions of <i>Multimedia as a Student Tool: A Guide for Teachers</i> and co-edited <i>The Many Faces of School-University Collaboration: Characteristics of Successful Partnerships</i>.<br>
<br>
<i>Marianne's Perspective</i><br>
The power of online real-time communications became clear to me as early as 1979 while working with third graders. After students read a book by the author we would meet online they planned the questions they hoped to ask. Then online they would ask the questions and 'hear the author's voice' in a new way.  What an amazing experience that was for all of us!!  The impact on those early days stayed with me as my work with students and their teachers continued.<br>
<br>
I began using Tapped In (the first version) during our program's first course for teachers on how to integrate this new tool, the Internet, was developed.  We used it to bring in experts and new voices and to allow teachers, who might not have been able to join us, become a part of our class. We had two teachers from Alaska (during the 90s) who joined us in the summer on campus but who participated in the telecommunications class by joining us through Tapped In, and an LCD projector. It was an eye-opening experience for the F2F class and helped these folks from far away become a part of our learning community.<br>

<h2>[2] News Nuggets</h2>
One of Jim Levin's doctoral students, Melissa Smith, explored the uses of Tapped In as an online bridge between working American Sign Language interpreters, student ASL interpreters, and the Deaf community, as a major project in an advanced seminar Jim led during Winter Quarter. Melissa was able to tap into a surprisingly rich niche for interaction among student American Sign Language interpreters, working ASL interpreters, and members of the Deaf community.  She documents this in her paper for the seminar: <a href="http://tepserver.ucsd.edu/courses/tep297/wi04/MS.tep297fnl.doc">http://tepserver.ucsd.edu/courses/tep297/wi04/MS.tep297fnl.doc</a><br>
<br>
Melissa thinks the Tapped In interface makes sense for anyone who has a vested interest in communication for deaf and hard of hearing people and she invites teachers who teach deaf children to contact her at MBSmith@palomar.edu for more information about joining this dynamic group.<br>

<h2>[4] Tapped In Technology Tip</h2> 
<i>Joining a Group</i><br>
Only Tapped In members can join a group and only group members can enter a group room. Many of the events that are scheduled on the calendar are supported by group resource rooms which contain files, links and a discussion board to facilitate communication among group members. To join a group in Tapped In, log in and go to the SEARCH tab in the top right of the screen. Click on the GROUPS tab and enter the group name or topic you are looking for. When you press the FIND IT button you will get a list of matches. Go to the group identity page (click on the name of the group next to the green i icon). At the top of the group identity page will be a place to join or request to join the group. Once you submit this information you will receive email confirmation of your group membership. When membership is confirmed (if the group is public, this confirmation is automatic) the group name will be added to the Favorite Places menu and you will have direct access to the group room.

<h2>[5] TI Group Profile: AAMU Writing Project-by Sandra Shattuck</h2>
The Alabama A&M University (AAMU) Writing Project is one of 175 sites under the auspices of the <a href="http://writingproject.org">National Writing Project</a>, a federally funded, faculty development program in existence since 1973. The AAMU Writing Project group at Tapped In started as a site for participants of the Summer Invitational Institute, which took place in June '03 on the Alabama A&M campus. The technology liaison and I set up the Tapped In office well in advance and then presented the technology during an online meeting that took place in a computer lab. The teacher consultants, as the graduates of the Summer Institute are called, decided that online monthly meetings might help us keep our writing community connected across the different school districts. The first few meetings quickly indicated that other Tapped In members were interested in the topic of writing, and I began to see that the group could serve as an online writing support community. That's when our monthly meetings took on the name, WriteTalk.<br>
<br>
WriteTalk now functions as a place for Tapped In members to discuss their professional writing in whatever form (progress report, grant application, lesson plan, course evaluation, dissertation proposal, conference paper, journal article) and at whatever stage (brainstorming, drafting, revising, editing, publishing). We also discuss writing pedagogy and welcome teachers in all disciplines, primarily because one of the main tenets of the National Writing Project is that writing serves as a powerful tool for learning and teaching -in any subject area. Check out the emphasis on writing in the principles and standards developed by the National Council of Teachers of Mathematics, for just one example.<br>
<br>
Our discussions have focused on a variety of writing, from the draft of the text for a digital story, to the revision of a seminar paper into an article, to a website aimed at teen poets. Our conversations range from fear of writing, to how to deal with a teacher's writing expectations, to the conventions of a book review, to brainstorming about how to carve out more time for writing. During our last meeting, we tried an impromptu collective online freewrite, and that led to a month-long commitment from the participants to do more regular writing using prompts for timed writing practice.<br>
<br>
WriteTalk, like many Tapped In groups, I suspect, continues to morph its way into addressing the participants' collective needs, ideas, and creativity. If you have any desire to talk about your professional writing or about writing in the classroom, come join us as we morph on!<br>

Tapped In currently has over 600 groups. To have your group featured in this new Tapis column, please contact BJ at bjb@tappedin.org  For more information on how to join a group see this month's Technology Tip.

<h2>[6] Project WHIRL Workshop with Handhelds </h2>
The Project WHIRL (<a href="http://projectwhirl.org">http://projectwhirl.org</a>) team invites you to attend a hands-on workshop with handhelds, Wireless Handhelds for Improving Reflection on Learning in Your Classroom, on Sat., June 19. The workshop is part of the NECC 2004 program in New Orleans, June 19-23.<br>
<br>
In this workshop, you'll receive software that you and your students can use in science, and learn how to use the software to better understand what your students know and can do (i.e. formative assessment). Education researchers and teachers co-designed the software. While the software was designed for science, teachers are using it in language arts, social studies, and math classes at the elementary level. We will be giving away several of the software applications to all workshop participants!<br>
<br>
For details, see the description in the NECC program at <a href="http://center.uoregon.edu/conferences/ISTE/NECC2004/program/search_results_details.php?sessionid=254955">http://center.uoregon.edu/conferences/ISTE/NECC2004/program/search_results_details.php?sessionid=254955</a><br>
