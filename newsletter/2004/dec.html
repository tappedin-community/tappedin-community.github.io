<h2>[1] Warm Wishes for the Holiday Season from Tapped In</h2>
We want to thank each and every one of you for joining and being part of the Tapped In community. Our membership has now grown to over 21,000 and each month over 10% of you log in. Every member in Tapped In brings something valuable to contribute--a new perspective, knowledge to share, a question, or enthusiasm for teaching and learning. [See tech tip.] With this growth as a community, we see more and more instances of how much each of you care and want to help others reach their full potential as an educator. We believe that this caring is what sets Tapped In apart from other places. We hope that you find value in being able to share and learn with other educators online in the community. Because we value your input so greatly, we also hope you will help us plan for the expansion of our technology and community services by taking 30 seconds to answer our <a href="http://www.surveymonkey.com/s.asp?u=51948718366">anonymous poll</a>. <br>
<br>
If you find yourself too busy, and want to keep reading our newsletter and "lurking" in the community, that is ok too. Join us whenever you can--we'll be here.<br>

<h2>[2] Member Perspective: Bonnie Feather</h2>
Bonnie has taught high school music in Australia, preschool, first grade, fourth grade, and University level. Currently she is very interested in helping teachers to integrate technology with their teaching, since students are outpacing us quickly using technology as a learning tool. In addition to providing teacher support for the Northern Arizona Regional Training Center, Bonnie also been actively navigating online courses for the Arizona School Services for Educational Technology and PBS/TeacherLine.<br>
<br>
<i>Bonnie's Perspective</i><br>
I work as a Technology Trainer in 6 counties of Arizona.  Since our counties are among the largest in land area in the country, that's an area about the size of France!  I visit and support all of the districts and charter schools in that area.  Of course, many of these schools are rural, and many of them have affiliated sites that are hundreds of miles apart from each other.<br>
<br>
When I teach administrators and teachers about Tapped In, it never fails that I hear wide-eyed comments.  "This is just what we need..."  "How much does a subscription cost?" (I love answering this one!) "We could use this for..."<br>
<br>
I use Tapped In as a way to collaborate with colleagues far away.  I can post a document to my office, and my colleagues can have access to it for review or revision.  I can have access to documents on the web without disks, or even a flash drive!  I have collaborated with people from other states, and even one from South Africa!<br>

In talking about bringing her students to the K-12 Student Campus, Tapped In member Jackie Parkins commented, "They really love posting on this! It's probably the best idea I've had all year. It keeps my students talking long after school is over! Tapped In is definitely the "buzz" word around Hopewell-Loudon these days. Students really seem drawn to this! I love being able to see them connect with each other. Students that don't normally talk in class to each other are tapping in and chatting! I love it!"<br>
