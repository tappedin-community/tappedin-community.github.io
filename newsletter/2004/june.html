<h2>[4] Tapped In Technology Tips</h2> 
This month's Technology Tips focus on several new features that have recently been added to the Tapped In interface:<br>
<br>
<i>Discussion Board Sorting</i><br>
You can now sort discussion threads in each room by date of first post, date of last post and subject.<br>
<br>
<i>Time and Date Displays</i><br>
All Tapped In members who have not set their time are requested to log in, click on the ME tab and then click on SETTINGS. Scroll down to My Calendar Preferences and the Edit Your Calendar Preferences link if your time zone is different from U.S. Pacific Time. The newly added time and date features will allow you to see the calendar events in your time zone. On the welcome page for all the public conference rooms and Reception welcome screen these features will also show you if a scheduled calendar event is in progress in a room and the date and time of the next event.<br>
<br>
<i>Member Profile</i><br>
A link to a member's profile has been added to the welcome note in private offices and the in-progress calendar notices. To update your member profile, go to the ME/Settings tab when you are logged in.<br>

<h2>[5] 10 Steps to Having a Successful Chat in Tapped In</h2>
The following information was compiled as a guideline to help you have a successful experience when you participate in a discussion, whether it's during the TI Festival 2004 or during any of the regularly scheduled calendar events in Tapped In. Please remember that Discussion Leaders have spent a great deal of time preparing for these discussions and only have one hour to present their material. Your attention and courtesy is appreciated. The discussion leader will allow time for questions and interaction.<br>
<br>
1. To DETACH your chat window and make it larger and easier to read, click on the ACTIONS drop down menu in the upper right of the chat window and scroll all the way down to DETACH.<br>
<br>
2. Use the PRIVATE MESSAGE to greet and talk to friends. When a friend enters the room and you want to greet them or ask them a question, double click on their name under the HERE tab to the left of the chat window. This will open a new small window. Enter your comments in the bottom of the window and press return on your keyboard. This message is PRIVATE and will only be seen by the person you send it to. This avoids a lot of distracting off-topic chat in the main chat window.<br>
<br>
3. Use the PRIVATE MESSAGE to ask for help. If you have any questions about Tapped In or how to do something, send a PRIVATE MESSAGE to the discussion moderator (usually the person who introduces the discussion leader and asks people to introduce themselves).<br>
<br>
4. Give a brief introduction. If the moderator calls for introductions, give your discipline, grade, and location.<br>
<br>
5. LISTEN to what the moderator has to say. The Moderator offers tips on participation, introduces the Discussion Leader and sets the ground rules for the discussion. <br>
<br>
6. LISTEN to what the Discussion Leader has to say. Before you ask any questions or make any comments, give the Discussion Leader the courtesy of your attention. You will then be prepared to contribute to the dialogue in an informed way.<br>
<br>
7. Click on a hyperlinked URL to open a webpage. When the Discussion Leader shows a URL it is hyperlinked. When you click on the hyperlink, a new webpage will open for you. You can open the page, look at it, and then close it if you wish. Do not minimize.<br>
<br>
8. WAIT for the Discussion Leader to ask for questions. Eager audiences are a joy for any Discussion Leader, but questions that are blurted out may take the discussion off-topic. Because of the limited time for each discussion, wait for the Discussion Leader to ask for questions and feedback.<br>
<br>
9. Use the PASTEBOARD to view unmoving chat text. During many discussions the chat scrolls very quickly and it is easy to lose the thread of the discussion. To view a section of the dialogue without having it scroll, click on the ACTIONS drop down menu and scroll down to SEND TO PASTEBOARD. This will put the section of dialogue on a new non-scrolling window. When you have caught up, close the pasteboard window.<br>
<br>
10. Members receive an emailed TRANSCRIPT. If you are a member of Tapped In, when you are finished with the discussion and log out, a transcript of the discussion that took place while you were logged in will be sent to you at your Tapped In registered email address. The transcript will include all chat text, all text from private messages, and any URLs that have been shown.<br>
