Quote of the Month - "The creeds of individual freedom, democracy, and diversity indeed have unifying power. They inspire me, though I would temper them with equal recognition of community and responsibility." - Bart Laws</p>

<h2>[1] Member Perspective: Tom Reinartz</h2>
Tom has been using Tapped In for about five years. He has been teaching English/Language Arts at Rosemount High School in Minnesota for 10 years. For the past six years, he has taught technology courses for teachers at the University of Minnesota. In about six months he will complete his dissertation in Learning Technologies at the University of Minnesota. <br>
<br>
<i>Tom's Perspective</i><br>
I remember using version one of Tapped In and thinking it really was close to the most powerful learning tool that I had used in my teaching. Tapped In has been essential for my teaching and learning not only for its easy access, but because of the opportunities to meet and collaborate with others from around the world on just about anything related to education.<br>
<br>
When I first began integrating technologies into my teaching, I remember learning new technologies that were exclusive to our high school. Very few teachers from neighboring districts could access the same technology that, through a recent bond referendum, was available to teachers in our district. Since then, I know that technology simply mediates what is to be learned, and really, it's how the technology is used rather than the number of gadgets built into it.<br>

<h2>[3] Tips and Comments From the Experts</h2>
If everyone goes to my office and I project to the ones logged in, it will go to all. I am trying to set up a training session for faculty at CSUF and Tapped In is a great tool for communications and collaboration. Everyone will be logged in so I can share sites. - Otto Benavides<br>
--------------------<br>
I really thank you for changing the calendar and the time zone connection. I kept getting lost in the go to and find your zone way of figuring things out. The new way is really easier. Again, thanks! You all work so hard to keep this site going and it's wonderful! - Karen Williams<br>

<h2>[4] Tapped In Technology Tip</h2> 
<i>International Characters in Chat</i><br>
The chat system has been revised to allow international characters. Give it a test (especially if you have a foreign-language system) and let Tapped In know if you see any problems. To see characters in the chat window, your system must have the fonts installed, and be running a JVM that handles these fonts (newer Mozilla, or IE using the Sun java plug-in rather than the default Microsoft JVM).

<h2>[5] The Worms Crawl In...</h2>
Not only have we heard more and more in the last few weeks about email worms and viruses than we've probably wanted to, but we've also received emails condemning us for being the carrier of the dreaded disease! Frequently, these messages arrive in our mailboxes with our own return address. The nature of worms and viruses is that they like to gather all email addresses from an infected computer and send messages to them. It typically "spoofs" email addresses and sends messages to someone from someone else who is in your address book or whose email is stored somewhere on your computer. It is hard to trace who the infection is coming from because of how the virus or worm sends the messages.<br>
<br>
Additionally, there are other worms and spammers who often spoof email addresses for fun or for malicious reasons. Recently, staff members at Tapped In got a message from themselves notifying them that their email account was about to expire and that they should open the attachment to learn more about it. This was NOT a real message. The attachment was a virus or worm. We didn't open the attachment and only hope that if you receive this from a Tapped In address (it is NOT from us, but from a spammer) that you won't open it either. If you ever receive an email asking you to open an attachment or forward it on to people or send back personal information, don't do it! Make sure it's legitimate first! See the resources below for more information.<br>
