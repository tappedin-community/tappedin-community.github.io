<h2>[1] Member Perspective: Terri Zopf-Schoessler</h2>
Terri Zopf-Schoessler is a 20-year veteran English, drama and, sometimes, dance teacher at Skyview High School in Soldotna, Alaska. She has been using Tapped In since January 2003 during her ARCTIC (Alaska Reform in the Classroom through Technology, Integration, and Collaboration) training in Juneau, Alaska. (The ARCTIC program was a federally supported program that funded rural Alaskan teachers to attend intensive, month-long technology training in Juneau and a follow-up summer session. The grant also helped pay for technology equipment in their school districts.) For someone whose technology skills were limited typing and sending email, the technology immersion was, by turns, exciting, frustrating, enlightening, and overwhelming. However, since the training's goal was to teach teachers how to use technology - and help their students use technologies - to demonstrate their understanding, she survived and, eventually, became a technology convert. A narrative of her sometimes rocky journey can be found in her Case Study of TI2 research paper.<br>

<h2>[2] News Nuggets</h2>
The Minerva Dissemination Conference will be held in Leiden, The Netherlands on Sept. 17-18, 2004. The topic is "ICT in Education and Professional Development of Teachers: Examples of Good Practice." The outcomes of several European projects will be presented, focusing on ICT in teacher ed (for secondary ed in particular). Participants will learn about the added value of ICT in teacher ed, discuss a number of examples of good practice and have the opportunity of hands-on experience of various applications.<br>

<h2>[3] Tips and Comments From the Experts</h2>
After a Threshold/ISTE discussion with students in the Tapped In Student Campus, Tapped In member Julie Evans wrote, "I am truly overwhelmed by the experience - it went so well with the kids - we could not get them to sign off!  And they asked us for more time to talk and more opportunities like this."<br>
--------------------<br>
Tapped In member Deborah Tatar reports, "I am in San Diego for AERA, but my Computer supported Collaborative Work class is in Virginia, so we get to use Tapped In this afternoon!"<br>

<h2>[5] TI Group Profile: The Big6 - Moving Every Child Ahead by Ferdi Serim</h2>
Moving Every Child Ahead applies the most widely used problem solving process, the Big6, to craft an alternative approach to the goals of No Child Left Behind. Improved student achievement requires improved classroom practice, but where is the research to guide us? Can we build a community of "studied interventions" where groups of educators share the evidence they generate through our daily actions with kids? These are the questions we explore each month in our sessions for educators who may be new to the Big6 or seasoned veterans. We all learn from each other!<br>
<br>
The perception that schools must choose between compliance with NCLB and expanding their goals to incorporate 21st Century Skills is a false choice. 21st Century Skills is the road schools must travel to succeed in shifting to evidence based practice. Moreover, successful efforts are grounded in a systems-thinking approach that addresses the support required to ensure learning for all students, in terms of data-driven decision-making, capacity building and community connectedness.<br>
<br>
Solving these problems requires development of 21st Century Skills by school personnel as well as students. For example, for all students to reach High Academic Standards, schools need information about the learning profiles of each student, which interventions have been tried, and which have been successful for students with similar profiles. <br>
- For all limited English proficient students to become proficient in English and reach High Academic Standards, similar learning profiles need to be correlated to successful LEP interventions from other schools.<br>
- For all students to be taught by highly qualified teachers, systems must provide support for teachers to learn and incorporate 21st Century Skills into their own teaching and learning practices.<br>
- For all students to be educated in learning environments that are safe, drug free, and conducive to learning, community involvement and support must be developed, guided by evidence of effectiveness.<br>
- For all students to graduate from high school, longitudinal data that identifies critical points and effective strategies for intervention must be used to prevent students from dropping out.<br>
<br>
The information challenges of NCLB share many characteristics with those facing other 21st Century enterprises. Incorporating 21st Century learning skills both within the instructional processes, as well as the management processes used by schools and school people is an important decision for communities, policy-makers and educators. Such a commitment shapes decisions on fundamental questions about how we design, implement and assess instruction to meet the needs of all children.<br>
