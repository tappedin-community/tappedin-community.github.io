<h2>[1] Member Perspective: Frances Long</h2>
Frances lives and works online guiding others into the joys and struggles of an online environment. She is based in Vancouver, BC, Canada and works with <a href="http://knowplace.ca">http://knowplace.ca</a>. Knowplace through its private/public partnership with Capilano College, North Vancouver, BC, Canada offers courses to assist people to transfer their skills to the online environment.  Our Knowmates include but are not limited to: K-12 teachers, employment and career coaches, education consultants, University professors and college teachers. Frances has been involved with building online communities since 1995. <br>
<br>
<i>Frances' Perspective</i><br>
At the beginning of each month, new people join the Knowplace community. During the first week, we teach people how to communicate through instant message clients, and post messages in a learning community. During the second week, Helen Kershaw and I discuss the Tapped In community and encourage folks to join us in a virtual tour of Tapped In. Together, we join in the Tips and Tricks tour led on Tuesdays and Saturdays by a helpdesk volunteer from Tapped In. 
<br>
As the helpdesk volunteer is leading people through Tapped In, we are in the background using an instant message client, to communicate with our folks: <br>
<br>
- Help them enter into the system, <br>
- Find that tool that they missed,<br> 
- Guide them from one room to another, and <br>
- Teach them private chat techniques<br>
<br>
When our folks are fine, we assist other tour members who are new to the Tapped In community to find their way during the Tips and Tricks tour. We jump in whenever we can to guide others during the tour.<br>

<h2>[2] Vision: Transforming Teacher PD Online - by BJ Berquist</h2>
Since 1997 Tapped In has helped educators turn their dreams and visions into reality. By the time you read this article, the international membership of the Tapped In interface that was introduced in the spring of 2002 will have passed 20,000! I thought this membership milestone might be a good time to revisit the original vision of the Tapped In creators and see what sparked this energetic involvement of so many educators to proactively take responsibility for their own professional development. The following is from the About Tapped In page linked from the Tapped In homepage at <a href="http://tappedin.org">http://tappedin.org</a>. If you haven't visited this inspiring resource lately, take a couple minutes to scroll down the page, meet the creators, renew your vision and raise a glass to the next 20,000 members!<br>
<br>
Research has shown that student achievement is directly linked to teacher quality. State and national teaching standards provide a framework for teachers' professional growth that requires teachers to engage in ongoing professional development throughout their careers. The increasing demand for continuous professional development means that providers must expand face-to-face programs to include online activities and content that engage teachers anytime, anywhere. The growing recognition that no single organization can satisfy teachers' ongoing professional development needs requires that educators and providers form communities to share strategies, resources, and support. Tapped In was developed to support this vision.

<h2>[3] Tapped In Technology Tip</h2>
<i>HELP!</i><br>
The Tapped In helpdesk volunteers are always willing to answer questions from guests and members. Even though the helpdesk isn't staffed 24/7, you can still find answers to most of your questions by logging in to the Tapped In interface and clicking on the Help tab at the top of your screen. The Help tab has links to information about the people who volunteer for Helpdesk, FAQ, how to Navigate in Tapped In, methods of Communication and Tools that make Tapped In an interactive community. As with all the features in Tapped In, watch for new additions that are always on the way!<br>

Tapped In member Sergei Grid announces the 6th International BelNATE-IATEFL Conference "Teaching English as a World Language in the Information Age," November 3-5, 2004. The conference is designed to provide an opportunity for a discussion of ideas that will help those who are involved in ELT and Area Studies. It will address the changes that have taken place in ELT in recent years under the influence of information technologies and transformations in related fields. We hope that the conference will help initiate and advance a fruitful discussion about the ways to improve ELT in Belarus using the teaching strategies developed by some of our colleagues.<br>
