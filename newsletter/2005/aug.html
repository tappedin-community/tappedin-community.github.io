<h2>[1] Welcome to TI. I'm a helpdesk volunteer and I'm pulling my hair out! (With apologies to all bald volunteers ;-))</h2>

To most new Tapped In guests and members, the offer of assistance is a welcome relief when confronted for the first time by all the tabs, menus, links, and chat options. Although the Tapped In interface was designed to be as intuitive as possible, each user has his or her own comfort level when it comes to technology. The Tapped In Helpdesk volunteers are a generous group of people who do everything they can to make first experiences in the TI interface as easy as possible. They welcome new members, schedule tours on the calendar, answer questions, and help maintain the warm and welcoming community for which Tapped In is known. The following exchange brings to a head a problem with which the volunteers have recently been dealing.<br>
-----------------<br>
TI Member: I am looking for educational chat rooms.<br>
BjB: Hi. Welcome to Tapped In.<br>
BjB: Tapped In is a community of practice for educators. Chat is only one of the many features here.<br>
TI Member: Great!  How do I get to the educational chat rooms?<br>
-----------------<br>
It appears that several instructors of online courses, recognizing the value of the Tapped In community, have assigned students to either log in as guests or members and explore the interface - with little or no utilization of easily available background material, handouts, help files, scheduled tours, and interface guide at the <a href="http://tappedin.org ">TI homepage</a>. There is little evidence that any of these instructors are members of Tapped In and this exacerbates the problem.<br>
<br>
Tapped In is YOUR community. The influx of large numbers of clueless and inquisitive guests and members puts a strain on the small number of Helpdesk Volunteers. The purpose of this message is threefold - 1.) If you are guilty of sending students to Tapped In without properly preparing them, then the least you can do is log in with them as a group for a scheduled tour. 2.) Give the helpdesk volunteers some relief by volunteering one hour a week. All volunteers are mentored. 3.) Pass this message on to any online instructors who may be involved in sending students to Tapped In. <br>
<br>
The following is a sample of some of the dialogue Helpdesk has worked with during the first five days of August!<br>
<br>
Thanks, what's it all about? ~ Hi, I am trying to figure out what I should be doing. This is an on-line course and as part of our class discussion we are to explore Tapped In and then relate it to a reading that was assigned. ~ This is my first time in here. Where else can I visit? I need some resources for expanding my knowledge in technology. ~ I'm sure it is [more than a chat room], but for right now, I am working on an internet class and need to use this site to find a group to put on my paperwork. ~ Hi, how do I find a room with chat taking place? Any group I have gone to I'm the only one. My class assignment is to join a group and summarize the chat. Any comments?<br>

<h2>[2] I'm looking for an educational chat room.</h2>
Tapped In is not a chat room. It is a Community of Practice for educators. Chat is only one of the many features of the Tapped in interface. Other features for members include a private office, special interest groups, threaded discussion boards, storage for files and links, and a special K-12 Student Campus. Special Interest Groups (we have over 600) are primarily resource rooms where group members store their files and links. Groups will occasionally meet in their group rooms, but more often they use the threaded discussion board in their group room to communicate among themselves. If you wish to participate in a real time chat take a look at our <a href="/tappedin/do/CalendarAction?state=displayExtCalendar"> Calendar of Events</a>, log in a few minutes before the chat is scheduled, and a Tapped In Helpdesk Volunteer will get you to the room in which the chat will take place.<br>

Under the "Getting Started" section there is a link to the Interface Guide, Event Calendar, and Help Pages. The "Welcome to Tapped In" section includes such topics as:<br>

Tapped In member Linda Adimik logged in with this wonderful and greatly appreciated complement, "I just wanted to take a moment to thank you for all your help when I was just getting used to 'computer land.' I have learned a lot [more] than just writing this summer and I'm kind of excited about it! I don't know if I [will be able to] stay connected to Tapped In when the course ends. I know our room will close. So I thought I'd say thank you today!!"
