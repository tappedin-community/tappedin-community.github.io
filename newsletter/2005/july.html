Quote of the Month - "What lies behind us and what lies before us are small matters compared to what lies within us." - Ralph Waldo Emerson (1803 - 1882)</p>

<h2>[1] Member Perspective: Barbara (Bee) Dieu</h2>
<a href="http://elgg.net/bdieu">Barbara Dieu</a> or just Bee as we call her online, teaches EFL at the Franco-Brazilian high school in São Paulo. Together with <a href="http://e-poche.net">Aaron Campbell</a>, she leads the Blogstreams Salon Group at Tapped In to discuss web logging and web publishing projects and pedagogy and co-runs <a href="http://dekita.org">Dekita.org</a>, a community of educators promoting peer-to-peer communication in language learning by bringing learners, experts, tutors and mentors together through Web-publishing.<br>
<br>
Since 1997, she has been involved in <a href="http://members.tripod.com/the_english_dept/projects/files/collaboration.html">international collaborative projects</a> online. She is also a member of the <a href="http://www.geocities.com/vance_stevens/papers/evonline2002/webheads.htm">Webheads in Action</a>, <a href="http://www.cyber-langues.asso.fr/">Cyberlangues</a>, Tesol CALL and Braztesol. <br>
<br>
<i>Bee's Perspective</i><br>
When BJB invited me to write this perspective, I tried to bring to mind how I had discovered Tapped In and when I first joined. I must have dug it during one of my exploratory trips across cyberspace. Fortunately, although my brain storage capacity is limited and memory retrieval does not improve as years go by, I found a back-up disk containing early TI folders with all the mails properly saved. This is thanks to just one of the many great features TI offers to its members: transcript of text chats are automatically e-mailed and main sessions archived for further reference.  It was fun to take a trip back in time, re-read the conversations, recognize familiar names and connect the dots. <br>
<br>
Strangely, although the first e-mail confirming my membership is dated 3/13/01, my first visit only occurred seven months later. There are a few monthly newsletters in between announcing the After School Online events so I suspect that for some time, I just lurked and what finally made me come out of my hiding on October 23rd was the announcement of a session on web quests in EFL led by Phil Benz. I had been trying hard to develop one on my own following the advice given on Tom March's and Bernie Dodge's site but became bogged down in the middle.<br>
<br>
I landed at the Reception 50 minutes early to get acquainted with the environment and was warmly received by BJB (another Barbara), who gave me tips on how to interact, use the interface and introduced me to Phil. In no time, we discovered, to our delight, that although we were on different continents and had never heard of each other before, we were talking the same language, working and heading in the same direction. It was on this memorable occasion that I also met TonK who had just started his Talenquest in the Netherlands and from then onwards, life was never quite the same. There was always an interesting session to attend, resources to share, incredible people to exchange ideas with, "elective affinities" and cutting edge tools/practice being discussed in a relaxed non-threatening atmosphere.<br>
<br>
When you are starting, it is important to be heard and trusted, receive support and encouragement to keep confident and move forward. Under the helpful and caring guidance of BJB, KeikoS, MaggiD, DavidWe at the Help Desk and tutored by experienced members like PhilB, I gradually started meeting more and more people, sharing resources and accepting more responsibilities.<br>

<h2>[5] Informal Survey of Exceptional Online PD</h2>
In April, Tapped In Director Mark Schlager sent out an email to approximately 2,000 Tapped In members asking them to identify an online professional development (PD) course or program that they had participated in (as an instructor or learner) and felt was exceptional. More than 100 people responded, and many asked if we would publish the results. The recommendations included university masters degree programs, district PD programs, PD offered by vendors and nonprofits, and mentoring programs, highlighting the breadth of online experiences that people associate with professional development.. The programs receiving more than one vote were: <br>
<br>
Atomic Learning by Atomic Learning, Inc.<br>
Connected University by Classroom Connect/Harcourt Education Company<br> 
ETLO Program by EDC <br>
my e-Coach <br>
Pepperdine University OMAET program <br>

<h2>[6] Siemens Westinghouse Competition for Math and Science</h2>
The Siemens Foundation sponsors the prestigious Siemens Westinghouse Competition - the nation's premier research-based science and math competition for high school students, and is administered by the College Board. <br> 
<br>
Online registration and instructions for entering the 2005-06 Competition in Math, Science & Technology are posted at www.siemens-foundation.org and www.collegeboard.com/siemens. Students who are not able to complete the application process online may call 1-800-626-9795 ext. 5930 from 9am to 5pm EST.  The deadline for entries is Monday, October 3, 2005.<br>
<br>
The competition awards college scholarships ranging from $1,000 to $100,000.  Students may enter as individuals or as part of a team. Entries are judged at the regional level by esteemed scientists and faculty at six leading research universities: Carnegie Mellon University; University of Notre Dame; University of California, Berkeley; Massachusetts Institute of Technology; Georgia Institute of Technology; and The University of Texas at Austin.  The national finals are judged by a panel of prominent scientists and mathematicians.<br>

<h2>[7] Graduate Student Seeks Teachers for Online Survey</h2>
My name is Yoke Meng Chan, a doctoral student at Texas Tech University. I am asking teachers to respond to three short <a href="http://www.educ.ttu.edu/survey/tmotivation2005">electronic questionnaires</a>.  This survey is about teacher motivation when teacher attrition is an issue in high-poverty schools. Teacher's responses to this survey are closely related to understand teacher's self-knowledge about teaching diverse students in high-poverty schools. Teachers need approximately 15 minutes to complete this survey. Even if you do not teach in high-poverty schools, your opinions are much needed to provide broader comprehension about teacher motivation to teach in schools today. Please feel free to contact me (yoke-meng.chan@ttu.edu) if you have any questions. Thank you very much.<br>
