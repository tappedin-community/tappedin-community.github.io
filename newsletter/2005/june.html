Quote of the Month - "The important thing is not so much that every child should be taught, as that every child should be given the wish to learn." - John Lubbock (1834 - 1913)</p>

<h2>[1] Member Perspective: Rita Zeinstejer</h2>
Rita is an EFL teacher in Argentina, an advocate of CALL (Computer Aided Language Learning) and of CMC (Computer Mediated Communication) tools for language learning. <br>
<br>
<i>Rita's Perspective</i><br>
Some 4 years ago, I came across Tapped In and immediately realized it was the place to share experiences, queries and achievements with people with my same interests. Reality surpassed my expectations, as not only did I expand my little knowledge on the use of synchronous and asynchronous tools for educational purposes, but mostly and most significantly, I gained the chance to meet and make true friends all over the world.<br>
<br>
Tapped In is, to me, as well as for so many other Webheads in Action, our home. Even to those who for different reasons do not join the Sunday meetings too often, Tapped In is unique. And this has several explanations. To start with, having a corner of one's own - an "office" - adds a very special sense of belonging. Files can be uploaded there, as well as photos, quotes and notes, which all give a personal touch to the environment. "Featured Passageways" provide us with the chance to post links to other members' offices, as if open doors showing the way. Whiteboards for visitors to leave their messages, Discussion Boards ready to be shared. And there is the calendar, reminding all members of events and meetings in advance, as well as timetables and proceedings. And free and easy access to archives and files of past events.<br>
<br>
And then all the other options, which are true gates to the world. Educators from all corners can meet here and communicate in real time with likeminded people. We meet and discuss, question and answer, explore and analyze, have fun and share.<br>

<h2>[2] Tapped In Festival 2005 Certificates of Participation</h2>
"Creating Connections through Collaboration" was chosen as the theme of this year's Tapped In Festival to help new and experienced users better understand the many features available in the Tapped In interface. Certificates of Participation are again offered to anyone who attends three or more events during the 12 hour Festival. Codes, given at the end of each event, will enable participants to fill out a participation form and provide feedback about the event after each session. Forms will be tabulated and electronic certificates will be posted within Tapped In.  Participation in one pre-festival tour will also count as one hour toward the certificate. Take advantage of this opportunity and ask your school district or university professor if they will accept your Festival Certificate of Participation for Continuing Education Credits!<br>

<h2>[4] Tapped In Technology Tip</h2>
<i>Virus Warning!</i><br>
A new email virus, named W32.Mytob.EH@mm, is spreading rapidly. This virus can only infect Windows computers -- all other computers (Macintosh, Linux, Solaris, etc) are safe from this virus. <br>
<br>
The virus sends infected messages purporting to be from official SRI email addresses such as "register@tappedin.org", "admin@tappedin.org", or "service@tappedin.org" and claims that: 1) you have changed your password, 2) your records are out of date, 3) that you sent a large amount of spam, or 4) that your email account has been disabled. If you receive such a message, do not open the attachment. Instead, simply delete the message and empty your Trash folder. <br>
