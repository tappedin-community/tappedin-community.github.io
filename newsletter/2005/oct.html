Quote of the Month - "Personally I'm always ready to learn, although I do not always like being taught." - Sir Winston Churchill</p>

<h2>[1] Member Perspective: Chris Champion</h2>

Chris Champion teaches Computer Information Systems at Cumberland-Perry Area Vocational-Technical School in Mechanicsburg, Pennsylvania (near Harrisburg).  He's been teaching for four years after working in the computer industry for nearly ten.<br>

<i>Chris' Perspective</i><br>
I found out about Tapped In by attending a conference for Pennsylvania technology leaders in Education - what the Pennsylvania Department of Education calls "Keystones."  During this busy week-long conference, I got a snapshot of how Tapped In could be used, but I never expected TI to have such a significant impact in my class.  I'm currently working on my Master's Degree from an online university (Walden University), so I was not a neophyte to classroom content delivered via the web.  I've also used Blackboard in my class in the past, so I have an idea of how to use that content as a teacher, not just a student.  The thing I never counted on was the genuine engagement of students as a result of their using Tapped In.<br>

<h2>[2] Hurricane Central Help Center Group - by Beth Wellman</h2>
In response to Hurricanes Katrina and Rita, Tapped In's Hurricane Central Group will be coordinating a tutoring center for K-12 students and teachers impacted by the disasters. The TI Student Campus will serve as a place for hurricane-affected teachers, homeschoolers, and their students to work together with volunteer teachers and pre-service teachers who will offer tutoring. This environment will also provide classroom and support resources such as lesson plans, emotional support resources, and collaborative opportunities. Hurricane Central is a place for educators to work together on the challenges that we face. If you are a teacher or pre-service teacher and would like to volunteer, let us know who you are and what content and grades you are interested in tutoring. If you are a teacher or homeschooler in an affected school district, let us know who you are and what needs you have. There will be special tours and mentors will be provided if you are not familiar with the Tapped In community. Join us by logging in with a free membership and let a friendly helpdesk volunteer get you to the Hurricane Central Group room.<br>

<h2>[3] Tapped In Mini-Expo for Pre-Service Teachers</h2>
What is the relationship between pre-service teachers, teacher education faculty, and the integration of technology into the classrooms of tomorrow?  Does Thomas Friedman's view that the <a href="http://mitworld.mit.edu/video/266/">World is Flat</a> affect how and what we should be teaching?  How does MIT's <a href="http://cba.mit.edu/projects/fablab/">Fab Lab</a> affect this conundrum?  Join the dialogue on the Pre-Service Teachers group room discussion board from October 22-25. If you are a member of the Pre-Service Teachers group, you can add your ideas about this Expo to the folders on the discussion board in the group room. There will be a live chat on Monday, October 24 with Sedat Akayoglu's pre-service teachers in Turkey. Don't miss this first combination synchronous/asynchronous TI Mini Expo!<br>

<h2>[4] Tapped In Technology Tips</h2>
<i>K-12 Student Group Collaboration</i><br>
It is now possible for two student groups to collaborate in the student campus. This means that the teacher from Group A can invite the teacher and students from Group B to enter Group A's room, post to the discussion board, share files, and have collaborative discussions.  Group A will also be able to do likewise in Group B's room.<br>
<br>
<i>Marking Messages</i><br>
The discussion boards now implement a more legitimate "new" behavior.  The NEW symbol has been replaced with a yellow circle that appears if you have not yet seen that message (not counting email). You can also mark all messages in the discussion board as "read" with the link at the top of the Discussion page.<br>
<br>
The saved messages under your ME tab now have a check box to mark as read or delete. This allows you to mark several messages at a time rather than having to mark individually. <br>

<h2>[5] News Nuggets</h2>
Thanks to Emily Weinberg for the following suggestion.  The <a href="http://www.tutormentorconference.bigstep.com/">Tutor/Mentor Conference</a> (Nov. 17-18) in Chicago also has an e-conference component. Participation in this conference is a great way to spread the word about the TI Hurricane Central Help Center, online learning and tutoring on Tapped In, recruiting teachers, and getting more ideas for activities for Hurricane Central. If interested in participating in the Tutor/Mentor Conference, please join the Hurricane Central group, go to the group room and post to the featured Tutor/Mentor folder on the discussion board. <br>

<h2>[6] Internet Survey for Art Teachers - by Craig Roland</h2>
This survey will collect data about how art teachers are using Internet technologies both at home and in the classroom. All K-12 art teachers are invited to complete this survey on their personal, professional, and instructional use of the Internet. The 20-item survey is designed to be answered in ten minutes or so. Results of the survey will be reported on the <a href="http://www.artjunction.org/atg">Art Teacher's Guide to the Internet</a>. <a href="http://www.artjunction.org/survey/public/survey.php?name=arted">Take the survey</a>.
