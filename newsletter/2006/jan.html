<h2>[1] Tapped In Mini-Expos in the Works...</h2>

In the coming months, TI Mini-Expos will include:<br>
<br>
<i>Hurricane Central Help Center</i> - A discussion on how TI members can provide mentoring and assistance to teachers and students displaced by the Gulf Hurricanes.<br>
<i>English in the World</i> - An exploration of how ESL/EFL teachers approach the learning of the English language in all its permutations.<br>
<i>K-12 Career Fair</i> - Targeting K-12 students with career ideas as they navigate the often confusing territory of choosing a career are on the planning schedule. <br>
<br>
All Mini-Expos will have both synchronous and asynchronous components. If you are interested in helping plan any of these Expos or would like to participate in the collaboration that will take place during each Expo, join the TI Mini Expos Group and post to the appropriate folder on the discussion board. To join a group in Tapped In, log in, SEARCH GROUPS, enter the group name, go to the group ID page, and join or request to join the group.

<h2>[2] Tapped In Technology Tip</h2>
<i>Potpourri of Assorted TI Interface Tweaks</i><br>
PEOPLE: Log in to TI, go to the Tapped In tab/sub-tab PEOPLE and see what fun new items have been added to the page. <br>
<br>
TIME ZONE SETTING: When a person fills out the membership form their time zone for the interface is automatically set. This allows new members to automatically see the calendar of events and all times in the interface in their time. (If you became a member before this feature was added, you will still need to go to the Calendar one time and set the time.)<br>
<br>
GROUP ARCHIVING: Although not new, many groups are reaching their renewal date, causing concern among those not familiar with the dreaded "this group will be archived" message! The maximum length of time for any group when it is created is one year, after which the group must be renewed or be archived. An automated message is emailed to all members of a group although only the owner or moderator can renew the group. If you are concerned that your favorite group is going to disappear and you don't want that to happen, go to the group room and post a request to the others in the group to support renewal.<br>
<br>
K-12 GROUP COLLABORATION: Many thanks to Jeff Cooper who posted a request about K-12 Group Collaboration to the TI Needed Features Group and to our amazing TI Wizards who made this happen!  Jeff felt that the ability to collaborate between two groups was an extremely useful tool, but to have students from one K-12 class collaborate with students from another K-12 class, the teacher needed to allow access to *the entire K-12 campus*, thus allowing private chat messages to be sent from other K-12 student groups. Jeff requested a TI "tweak" that would permit collaborating groups to visit each other's room without having to open the entire SAC campus to them.<br>
