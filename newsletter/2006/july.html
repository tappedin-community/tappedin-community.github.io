Quote of the Month - "You can teach a student a lesson for a day; but if you can teach him to learn by creating curiosity, he will continue the learning process as long as he lives." - Clay P. Bedford</p>

<h2>[1] Member Perspective: Jim Hicks</h2>
Jim Hicks retired in June 2006 with 32 years of experience as a teacher and counselor. He will be a part-time instructor in the fall of 2006 with the Kentucky Department of Education in the Virtual High School. Jim was originally introduced to Tapped In during a workshop conducted by the Kentucky Department of Education for Instructional Technology Leaders in the late 90s. At that time Tapped In did not have all the features that it has now. You could get an office but it was nothing more then a graphical space with which you actually had to design your own office using graphical software. Still the goal was to bring people together in a professional development atmosphere to share ideas. At the time Jim was an ITL and was introduced to the concept and became very interested in online learning. <br>
<br>
<i>Jim's Perspective</i><br>
I felt that this was a way of bringing together diverse groups of educators with many points of view that could improve the professional development opportunities for teachers. I have never been disappointed with this. Tapped In has proven time and again that it has the ability to bring people together to share ideas for the improvement of the profession. With the addition of the student campus there is now the ability to bring this type of online learning to our students. <br>
<br>
It has been ten years since that initial involvement, the Tapped In environment is now much more user-friendly then it was 10 years ago but the benefits are the same. It certainly has been of benefit to me. I retired from teaching this past year after 32 years of teaching science in Kentucky. I can now pursue one of my interests, online learning and teaching at the Kentucky Virtual High School.<br>

<h2>[2] Tapped In Festival 2006</h2>
The quote of the month, "You can teach a student a lesson for a day; but if you can teach him to learn by creating curiosity, he will continue the learning process as long as he lives," was chosen for all the TI educators who are continuing that learning process. To facilitate this process, you are invited to join the July 19 Tapped In Festival to help educators become engaged in and sustain lifelong learning. <a href="/tappedin/web/festival/ ">Read more about the Festival</a>.<br>

<h2>[4] Tips and Comments from the Experts</h2>
Su-hsun Tsai (ChristinaT in TI) sent this message to the Tapped In Helpdesk: My millions thanks to your sharing [information posted to the group discussion boards] from time to time.

More kind words from Tapped In member Edith Lopez-Millard: I love to come to Tapped In. I am in permanent learning.<br>

Tapped In member Devo Carpenter sent this note of appreciation to BJ and the members of the Alt/Correctional Ed group: I put Tapped In on a resource list for a panel program I did at the American Library Association called "Books behind Bars". Hopefully more librarians who are doing programs with their detention centers will use your great resource. I have enjoyed the information you send in the emails. I appreciate all you do.<br>

Tapped In member Sharon Harpster had some very exciting news to share about how Tapped In members collaborate! <br>
<br>
In February, 2006, I emailed you about getting a student to join our web team for the ThinkQuest educational website competition. You were able to get a student from Bulgaria for us. I just thought you might like to know that--with his help--we were able to win first place in the contest. [Visit the site, <a href="http://www.thinkquest.org/competition/index.shtml">IT'S ALL MINE!</a>]. Each student--including the team member from Bulgaria, will be brought, free of charge, to San Francisco, California [along with one parent] for 5 days. Each team member also won a laptop computer! <br>
<br>
I must say that, had it not been for your help in posting our need of a member, we never would have won. This team member was responsible for a significant part of the site. Thanks again for your help!!!<br>
