Quote of the Month - "I like nonsense, it wakes up the brain cells. Fantasy is a necessary ingredient in living, it's a way of looking at life through the wrong end of a telescope." - Dr. Seuss (1904 - 1991)</p>

<h2>[1] Opportunity to Help Those Affected by Gulf Hurricanes</h2>

The Tapped In Teachers Emergency Mentor Association is leading the Tapped In Hurricane Central Help Center Mini Expo, a group to provide support and mentoring for teachers and students displaced by the Gulf hurricanes and other disasters. The dates are March 20-25 and include opportunities for TI members to mentor teachers in overcrowded classrooms by using the TI Student Campus or volunteer as a homework helper for PATH.  Participate in tours of the Tapped In interface and Student Campus, a weather resource discussion with Timothy Schott from the National Weather Service, a presentation on the Hurricane Digital Memory Bank by Sheila Brennan, a discussion on counseling resources to help students and educators address Post Traumatic Stress Syndrome with Barbara Muller Ackerman, and a chance to learn about and volunteer for PATH, Pupils Asking, Teachers Helping, a homework help site staffed by teachers. <br>
<br>
Join the Hurricane Central group and look at the folders with Lesson Plan Ideas, Your Stories, My Classroom Needs. Folders have also been placed in the Student Campus Hip Hop Studio to give students an opportunity at "normalcy" and talk to other students about Games, Multimedia, Music, Movies, Raps and Rhymes. <br>
<br>
Don't miss this opportunity to help your education colleagues by doing what you do best - teach through collegial support!<br>

<h2>[2] What's New for the Tapped In Community?!</h2>

New events are frequently being added to the Tapped In calendar, so make sure you visit often! Pepperdine University, long time tenant in TI (since 1998), is beginning to host new online events and inviting TI members to join them. One type of event will be the Alum/Student Spotlight. <br>

The first event, Monday, March 20, 2006 at 6pm PST, features <a href="http://hale.pepperdine.edu/~pareynol/PARessay.htm">Paul Reynolds</a>.

Keep watching the calendar for more exciting events from Pepperdine. <br>

<h2>[5] Tips and Comments from the Experts</h2>
TI member Paddy Greenleaf posted a request for advice to the Webheads yahoo email group.  TI member Carla Arena responded with a great testimonial for the TI K-12 Student Campus and the Tours led by helpdesk volunteers!  Thanks, Paddy and Carla, for granting permission to use your messages in the Tapis.<br>
<br>
Dear all, can you advise? What's the best advice to give other teachers about taking YL students to the chat rooms in Tapped In? I have a private room and use the chat facility there with my students, but I still run the risk of students wondering off to chat in other windows in TI - I'm not sure what the guidelines are so don't want to give 'wrong' advice in a seminar to other teachers! - Paddy<br>
<br>
Do you know about the Students' Campus in TI? It's a safe place for them. Another thing is contacting the help desk to have a tour with a group of teachers. Once Erika and I had a workshop about Tapped in and Jeff had a virtual tour with the participants. They loved it! - Carla<br>
