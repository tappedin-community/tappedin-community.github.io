<h2>[1] Joint Member Perspective: Mary Mindess & Ann A. Adams</h2>
Tapped In as a Tool for Collaboration Among Preservice Teachers<br>
<br>
We met on the bus going to the airport Ð two college professors, one headed south to Mobile, Alabama, and the other headed north to Cambridge, Massachusetts.   We both were planning social studies methods courses to be offered at our respective institutions the following semester.  We shared a common goal: the desire to stimulate collaboration among our preservice teachers and to afford them the opportunity to be a part of a community of learners.<br>
<br>
Many of these students had a firmly rooted view of themselves as teachers in a classroom with a group of children.  They viewed their principals and supervisors as the assessors of their work and gave very little thought to the potential value of peer review and critiques, particularly from peers they had never met.<br>
<br>
For many students their idea of a peer critiquing their work meant that their work was inadequate.  Our challenge was to change this perception.<br>

<h2>[2] News Nuggets</h2>
The Indiana Council for the Social Studies has named TI member Michael Hutchison their "distinguished teacher" for 2006.<br>
--------------<br>
TI member Michael Ivy invites members to contribute articles, commentaries, stories, opinions, illustrations to <a href="http://www.britishcouncil.it/metro">MetroZine</a>, a webzine for all ESOL students. Michael is planning to co-opt some of the students at the British Council onto an editorial team. The e-zine is an online community where students of English at the British Council in Rome can post homework. <br>

In requesting permission to use screen shots and text from TI for her upcoming book, Jane Howland wrote:  Tapped In is a resource I've shared with my graduate students for many semesters in the "Learning with the Internet" course. Most of the course focuses on K-12 student use of the Internet, but Tapped In has been a great site for teachers' professional development, too. Thanks!<br>

<h2>[3] Tips and Comments from the Experts</h2>
After last month's introduction of Pioneers and Explorers, TI member Christina Su-hsun Tsai sent in this response: It is such a wonderful idea to set up "Pioneers and Explorers."  Transana in the October 06 ...On the Tapis is such a wonderful program.  I use CLAN for text analysis.  I was wondering if there would be a free software for analyzing video clips taken from an educational observation.  Now there's a hope to use Transana. Thank you very much for this, and thank you to TI, especially to the one who created this idea to share what the pioneers have been trying.  (Send your Pioneers and Explorers information to BJ Berquist at bjb@tappedin.org)<br>

TI Volunteer: glad to hear that, Sondra. I know the interface can be overwhelming at first because there is so much to see but once you learn the basics, its pretty user friendly<br>
Sondra: yes, and I have no experience with online chat...  It's been a great experience!<br>
Pinar: for me too<br>

<h2>[6] Women and Girls in Science and Engineering</h2>
WAMC Northeast Public Radio's production team has produced: Powerful Signals: Transforming the Role of Women and Girls in Science and Engineering. Funded by the National Science Foundation, the two-part radio series consists of ten feature-length stories about programs across the U.S. that work with young girls to encourage the next generation of women in science and engineering; and three audio diaries that follow the day to day lives of women who chose a course of study or career in science and technology. For more information on the project, to hear audio of the stories, or find out more about how to get a free compact disc, visit the WAMC Women in Science, Technology, Engineering & Mathematics ON THE AIR! website at <a href="http://www.womeninscience.org">womeninscience.org</a> or email dwertheim@wamc.org.<br>
