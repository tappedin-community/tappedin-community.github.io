Quote of the Month - "All our work, our whole life is a matter of semantics, because words are the tools with which we work, the material out of which laws are made, out of which the Constitution was written. Everything depends on our understanding of them." - Felix Frankfurter (American Jurist, 1882-1965)</p>

A tree-hugger? Maggi Doty invites you to climb into the Green Room tree house and she will show you the facts as they come in and what is available.<br>

<h2>[4] Tapped In Technology Tip</h2>
<i>Join a person? Join a group? Join a discussion?</i><br>
What is the difference among those three choices?! As it turns out, there's quite a bit of difference and it seems that this is causing some confusion for new Tapped In members. Language can be pretty tricky and is the reason for the use of the quote for this month. Let's take a look at each use of the term "join."<br>
<br>
When you "join a person" this means that you move to the same room in which another person who is logged in is located. The best way to do this is to click on the ONLINE tab to the left of the chat window, click one time on the name of the person you wish to join, and then click on the door icon at the bottom of the frame.  For those techies who prefer text commands, type  /join <username>.<br>
<br>
Joining a group is a different kind of "join." When you join a group you become a member of the group and are listed on the group's membership page. Becoming a member of a group also subscribes you to the group discussion board and allows you to post and receive posts from that board. If you need help in joining a group, ask one of the HelpDesk volunteers or use the Help tab in the top right of the screen when you are logged in and read about Groups. If you decide that you no longer want to be a member of a group, you must go to the group ID page and click on "Leave this Group."  Leaving a group removes you from the list of group members and from any permissions that the individual group members have such as entering the group room, accessing files and links in the group room, and reading and posting to the group discussion board.<br>
<br>
So, what about joining a discussion? There is actually a different term that is used, and it has apparently become equally confusing! To participate in a group discussion board (see above paragraph) and receive posts from the board in your email, you must be "subscribed" to the discussion. Any post to the group discussion board is sent to all the members of the group who are subscribed to the board and provides an easy way to contact all group members. You have the option of subscribing to receiving the individual posts or choosing a digest version that batches the posts. If you decide that you no longer want to get any posts from the group discussion board, go to Discussion in the group room and "unsubscribe." This does not remove you from the group, but only stops discussion posts from being emailed to you. You will still be a member of the group and still have the option of going to the group room and reading the posts.<br>
