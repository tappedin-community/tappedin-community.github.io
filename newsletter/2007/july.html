Quote of the Month - "When someone does something good, applaud! You will make two people happy." - Samuel Goldwyn, film producer</p>

<h2>[1] Member Perspective: Paul Bohac</h2>
Paul retired after thirty years in juvenile and adult corrections. The majority of his work in both arenas was in correctional education and in correctional special education, either as a teacher, consultant or administrator. <br>
<br>
<i>Paul's Perspective</i><br>
<br>
Following my retirement, I have been actively pursuing a Doctorate. To supplement my retirement income, I worked as an adjunct instructor for a University through a grant-funded project and currently for a local Community College. All of the courses I have been teaching have been on-line. It was through one of those University on-line courses that I met BJ Berquist (she was a student in one of the classes) and through her I was introduced to the Tapped In Community. <br>
<br>
When she asked if I would be willing to serve as a forum leader, I was skeptical. Although I visited the Tapped In site and was impressed with its diversity of topics and the level of involvement of the participants, I was not sure my role as a forum leader would be productive to forum members or would be worth the commitment of time and energy it would require. Not to mention, what would an ex-correctional educator be able to offer the special education community?<br>
<br>
What I learned though, after agreeing to serve as a forum leader, was that education of individuals with disabilities faces the same problems whether in a public school classroom, a private school classroom or inside the walls of a prison. What I also learned from forum participants has enhanced my on-line instructional activities with the local community college. It has become a very exciting, rewarding professional experience that I look forward to each month. Perhaps my involvement can help teachers of students with disabilities to become more sensitive to the individual students in their class and how some of the "behavioral problems" exhibited by their students might warrant closer examination. It is easier to help a child to achieve in the classroom than it is to help a youth or an adult to overcome the lack of classroom achievement.<br>


<h2>[2] Tapped In Festival: Playing to Learn</h2>
July 25 will be here before you know it! Don't miss this 12-hour online festival that includes topics to make you tap your toes and smile with joy at this playful perspective for teaching and learning opportunities.

<br>

<i>"Very helpful for me since I am a beginner on-line learner/teacher"</i><br>
<i>"Very good tutorial"</i><br>
<i>"This is a great place to visit"</i><br>
<i>"Moderator is nice"</i><br>
<i>"Learning how to navigate was a great highlight"</i><br>
<i>"I got started through a master's class I'm taking as an elective. The highlight is all the resources available and the helpfulness of everyone I've met here so far"</i><br>

TI member Lesley Farmer has an article, I See, I Do: Persuasive Messages and Visual Literacy, in the July issue of <a href="http://www.mmischools.com/Archives/ArchiveIssue.aspx?IssueId=322">MultiMedia & Internet@Schools</a>.
<br>
If a picture is worth a thousand words, then a few images can constitute a persuasive argument. Consider the impact of propaganda posters, of billboards, and of photojournalism. Creators of visual images leverage visual art principles to convey messages. In order to convince the viewer of a specific idea, mass media producers who understand the language and connotations of visual literacy can manipulate images to elicit desired responses - a strategy that is used increasingly with the advent of digital tools. Particularly in this electronic age, students need to know and apply technological visual principles and skills to become critical visual consumers and producers. <br>
<br>
Lesley leads the monthly Cybrarians discussions and will be presenting during the Festival on July 25.<br>
