Quote of the Month - "It is paradoxical that many educators and parents still differentiate between a time for learning and a time for play without seeing the vital connection between them." - Leo Buscaglia</p>

<h2>[1] Member Perspective: Danika Brown</h2>
Before coming to her current institution, the University of Texas, Pan American, Danika developed several online learning environments to support various writing courses. She helped design and develop "OldPuebloMOO" for the University of Arizona and also developed an online environment for professional writing courses that integrated what was called "Teamwave" at the time.<br>
<br>
<i>Danika's Perspective</i><br>
<br>
I am a professor of Rhetoric and Composition at the University of Texas, Pan American. Because I teach both writing and the teaching of writing, technology plays an integral role in my classrooms. My current institution does not have a diverse technological infrastructure (relying primarily on WebCT), and I found Tapped In as I investigated alternatives that I could use for writing courses. From the first time I logged in, I was hooked! Of all the polysynchronous Internet environments I have used, I find Tapped In one of the most flexible yet remarkably easy to use.<br>

<h2>[2] Online Collaboration: Transforming Curriculum Through Technology Beyond NCLB</h2>
On Saturday, June 23 from 8-2 Eastern, Jeff Cooper and David Weksler will conduct a hands-on workshop at NECC 2007 entitled "Online Collaboration: Transforming Curriculum Through Technology Beyond NCLB."  An overview of the workshop may be found <a href="http://snurl.com/necc2007">here</a>.<br>
<br>
The room has videoconferencing, several Web 2.0 tools and much of it will be mirrored using Tapped In. During the last 3 hours participants will work on setting up professional development groups and K-12 classes at Tapped In. There will also be mini breakout sessions, where educators may spend between 15 minutes and an hour in conference with the participants using Tapped In, videoconferencing, and/or several Web 2.0 tools. <br>
<br>
If you are interested in attending, or participating and sharing your expertise, please contact Jeff Cooper directly at jbcoops@gmail.com to be placed on the calendar. This is your opportunity to collaborate and support educators as well as picking up useful technology tips and tricks for the next school year.

The following lyrics can be used for your podcast or you can compose your own!<br>
<br>
A-Y-P, I-E-P, No Child Left Behind,<br>
Alphabet soup lurks like shadows in my mind.<br>
Testing, training, stress and strife,<br>
School makes a person want to get a life!<br>
Food fights, playgrounds, swinging rings,<br>
Sports, drama, choral sings.<br>
Planning, grading, assessments to the max<br>
The Institute of Learning is full of cracks.<br>
No wonder burn-out has teachers on the run.<br>
When did we forget that<br>
LEARNING SHOULD BE FUN!<br>
