<h2>[1] knowTIPS Conference</h2>
The <a href="http://knowplace.ca">3rd Annual knowTIPS Conference</a> (Mar. 28-Apr. 1) is just around the corner! Knowplace offers this annual online conference to help you turn theory into practice (TIPS). This conference brings together e-coaches, educational professionals and those who are interested in creating online sessions and developing a web presence. 

We "learn through our fingers" as we join our Presenters for asynchronous discussions, live Elluminate presentations, hands-on workshops and tours. 

Sarah Haavind and Marsha West join us once again to continue our exploration into facilitation strategies to help focus online learning. Therese Weel and Tia Car Williams provide an opportunity to investigate the many online tools and software available today. Tapped In's BJ Berquist and Jeff Cooper are leading an evaluation of the Tapped In community. Janet Salmons is sure to have a stimulating look at building trust in cyberspace. Rod Corbett and Jeff Hamilton are leading a workshop on Google Tools. Bruno Vernier will get us thinking about approaches to removing anxiety for participants in the online environment. While Marian Heddesheimer will share his knowledge and expertise with various synchronous tools. 

Visit <a href="http://knowtips.ca">Knowplace</a> for more information and to register for this annual event. The fee remains the same as last year $137 CDN.  Questions? Ask Helen Kershaw at helen@knowplace.ca or Frances Long at flong@knowplace.ca

<h2>[2] News Nuggets</h2>
David Weksler did a presentation on TI at the Rutgers math conference on Mar. 16.<br>
--------------<br>
Wiki Gathering About Researching COPs - One of the projects in the currently wrapping-up Foundations of Communities of Practice workshop ended up setting up a wikispace about researchers studying communities of practice. It's worth <a href="http://copresearch.wikispaces.com/">a look</a>.<br>
--------------<br>
TI member Tricia Ryan from Towson University presented TI at the Eastern Educational Research Assoc. Conference in Florida in February. A big TI thanks to new member Bob Perkins for bringing this to our attention!<br>

<h2>[3] Tapped In Technology Tip</h2>
<i>Whiteboards</i><br>
Each TI room contains an interactive text whiteboard where members can post an agenda for a meeting, take notes during a discussion, or brainstorm. You can access the whiteboard by clicking 'Whiteboard' in the room menu. Click on 'write on it,' add your text to the text window and press the 'write on Whiteboard' button. After the discussion, if you press 'Print To Note' at the bottom of the whiteboard, the text on the whiteboard is saved as a note that is added to Notes in the room menu.<br>
<br>
<i>Lost Transcripts</i><br>
Due to the recent number of new TI members, this tip is being repeated. If the email address a member has in the directory is correct, and that member has opted to receive chat transcripts, then, when that member logs out, a transcript is automatically sent to the email address on record.  Frequently, new members have not set their spam/junk folders to permit mail from TI and some email services will automatically dump TI email into those folders. If you don't get a transcript, that's the first place to check!<br>
<br>
If you still can't find the transcript for a discussion in which you have participated, then log in and click on the ME tab at the top of the screen. Click on Places in the yellow bar and select 'retrieve chat transcript.' You will be prompted to select the room in which the discussion took place. Once the room is selected you will be prompted to enter the date and times of the discussion. When you have done this, the transcript will again be emailed to the address you have in the member directory. Please note that this feature ONLY works if you were logged in and in the room during the discussion.
<br><br>
<i>Miscellaneous Stuff</i><br>
TI has sooo much information archived to help you become familiar with the features of the community. You can find past Tech Tips in <a href="/tappedin/web/newsletter/">archived newsletters</a>. And don't forget the wonderful Help tab at the top of the screen. If there is anything you have a question about and are not able to find an answer, stop in at Reception and ask one of the friendly helpdesk volunteers! We may not have all the answers right away, but we'll find out get back to you ASAP.
