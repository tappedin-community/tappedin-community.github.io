Quote of the Month - "She would rather light candles than curse the darkness and her glow has warmed the world." - Adlai Stevenson</p>

<h2>[1] Member Perspective: Diallo Sessoms</h2>
Diallo Sessoms is professor of Instructional Technology at Salisbury University. He teaches courses that introduce pre-service teachers to using technology in the classroom. The students in the course use TI to organize, collaborate, research, contribute, and share ideas.<br>
<br>
<i>Diallo's Perspective</i><br>
First, Tapped In encourages dialogue among students and provides a platform where all members make contributions to classroom discussions. Students use Tapped In to lead discussions of various readings during the semester based on some aspect of the reading as determined by the discussion leader. Other students respond and cite references to provide the class with a wealth of information. This allows students time be reflective and focused as the readings are discussed. It is also a way to get input from all learners. Traditional discussion has two limitations which are time and the ability of students to be silent during conversations. Using Tapped In for discussion erases the limitation of time and the ability of students to be silent.  <br>
<br>
Second, Tapped In can be used for students to do self-reflections as well as peer-to-peer evaluations. For example, as students learn to create digital stories, students are expected to read the script of a classmate and provide feedback. Additionally, students view the final video of the students and provide feedback for the movie. This space is also used for students to reflect on various assignments throughout the semester. Students evaluate their own work and discuss progress made towards a particular assignment. <br>
<br>
Third, pre-service students search for and become members of existing groups. This encourages professional development and provides a wealth of ideas from various educators. Pre-service teachers are exposed to the idea that learning is not limited to the walls of academia or the voice of a single professor. This collaborative nature allows students to experience a rich, diverse exposure to professionals. <br>

<h2>[2] Tapped In Community has Feet of Clay</h2>
People are said to have "feet of clay" if they are revealed to have a weakness or flaw that most people were unaware of. (<a href="http://Bartleby.com">The New Dictionary of Cultural Literacy, Third Edition. 2002</a>.)<br>
<br>
In our professional lives and in our online professional development opportunities we often overlook our clay feet - the joys and the sorrows that are interwoven into our daily lives are placed on hold as we put on our masks of "professionalism."  Educators are encouraged to leave personal agendas at the classroom door as they focus on their students' obstacles and achievements.<br>
<br>
We also often wear our cloak of professionalism during the TI activities, classes, calendar events, and informal discussions. However, over time cracks in the armor form and warm friendly relationships with colleagues can be developed.  The birth of children and grandchildren are celebrated, empathy is shared for illness and injury.  And, time has brought our community to the point where we lose some of our dear friends and colleagues to death.  It is with great sadness that we report that Leni Donlan, a long time TI member and community leader, passed away on October 31.<br>
<br>
To help us all through this loss and wish Leni well on her new "Westward Ho" wagon train trail, you are invited to participate in a TI Retrospective that will take place on December 5, 2007.  If you joined any of the Library of Congress Learning Page discussions, joined the Postcard Geography group, or rounded up the wagon train with Leni to explore the wild west, please watch the December TI calendar for the time of this retrospective and enter your comments and memories of this extraordinary lady.<br>
<br>
The Washington Post also has a <a href="http://www.legacy.com/WashingtonPost/GB/GuestbookView.aspx?PersonId=97401044">guest book</a> where you can express your condolences to Leni's family and colleagues. <br>

<h2>[3] Group Focus of the Month: Natural Disaster Help Center </h2>
The Hurricane Central Group name has been changed to Natural Disaster Help Center. The group was started to provide help and resources for the victims of Hurricane Katrina in 2005. Since then the group has posted resources for other natural disasters, including the devastating tsunami that struck in SE Asia. A new folder has been added to the group room for resources for victims of the Southern California wildfires. The group name was changed to Natural Disaster Help Center to reflect the variety of help offered in the group room.  If you have something to contribute, please do so!<br>

<h2>[6] Tapped In Technology Tip</h2>
<i>Tapped In Archived Transcripts</i><br>
If you've participated in any of the real time text chat events posted on the monthly TI calendars, you know that those discussions often contain a great deal of information expressed as experiences, resources, or informative dialogue. Did you also know that edited transcripts of most of those events are archived?! Almost five years of Calendar event transcripts are stored as PDF files at <a href="http://tappedin.org/transcripts">tappedin.org/transcripts</a>. At that URL is a SEARCH tab which allows you to search the external TI website for specific topics. Make sure you visit this incredible collection that the TI community has compiled.<br>
