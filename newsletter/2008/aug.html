<h2>[1] Festival 2008 is a Wrap!</h2>
The over 200 Certificate Sign-ups and total of 200 participants at all festival events (not including pre-festival tips and tricks) has kept the Festival Team busy!  Certificates for those who submitted 3 or more Certificate sign-ups are available on the <a href="/tappedin/web/festival/">Festival page</a>.<br>
<br>
If you participated in the festival and have not already done so, please fill out and submit both parts (About Festival and Tapped In for Professional Development and the Festival 2008 Reflection Form) of <a href="http://snurl.com/tisurvey2008">the survey</a> to help us continue to improve the Festival. <br>
<br>
A final festival report should be available by the September Newsletter. Transcripts are almost finished and will be posted in the 
Tapped In Festival 2008 transcripts folder.<br>

<h2>[2] Tips and Comments from the Experts</h2>
A warm thanks for TI member Jane Kurczak for sharing the following information:
<br>
"I have had [my students] blogging in their offices all week--and TI has been a real hit with the tech proficient and not so. But I have more in this training who want to involve their students in regular activities--it has been neat to see how positive and eager they are to use this interface. We have looked at a bunch of Web 2.0--and not all have been enthralled--but I get universally positive feedback on TI.  Always--you may quote me--my training session LOVES TI"<br>

TI member Gary Ledger gave the following evaluation of his participation in one of Dianne Allen's Pre-Festival Tips and Tricks: <br>
<br>
"The TNT tour was fun, informative, and valuable. In 90 minutes, I discovered that Tapped In is a Gold Mine of resources, for example the Math Group, with many super resources.  We had time to 'walk' around the Math room. Dianne was incredibly patient.  Thanks."<br>

<h2>[3] News Nuggets</h2>
TI member Kevan Nitzberg had a role as a 'virtual mentor' in a new art education-based 'wiki' called "<a href="http://creativityandcollaboration.wetpaint.com/">Creativity2: Collaborative Art Communities</a>" that is now online as an outgrowth of an Educational Leadership Institute that took place in Maine this summer under the facilitation of Dr. Barbara  Bridges. Doctoral students from Northern Illinois University are co-administrating this online community.<br>

<h2>[4] Tapped In Technology Tip</h2>
<i>Help Tab: Overview</i><br>
This Technology Tip is the first in a series to help the many new members become familiar with the tabs at the top of the Tapped In screen.  When logged in a row of tabs will appear at the top of the screen (Me, Tapped In, Help, Search). Each tab offers information about one or more of the many features of TI. This Tip is focusing on the Help Tab. When this tab is selected five sections of help information are available:  Help Desk, FAQ, Navigation, Communication, and Tools. The following is an excerpt from Help/Navigation/Overview:<br>
<br>
The Tapped In community is based on a room metaphor. While you are logged in, you are always in one room or another in Tapped In. The room you "land" in when you log in is called your home room. If you have chat enabled, anything you say will be "heard" by other Tapped In members that are currently in the room with you.<br><br>
TI is made up of different campuses on which there are one or more buildings. The Tapped In campus is home to the Tapped In Community Center and a building for each tenant. Most buildings have three floors: 1) the ground floor, 2) the groups floor, and 3) the offices floor. All buildings have a reception room on the ground floor and a lobby on all other floors. Every room in TI is located on exactly one floor of one building. The K-12 Student campus, which is adjacent to the Tapped In campus, is home to the Student Activity Center. All K-12 Student groups are in the SAC building.<br>
<br>
If you are interested in live real time help or have any questions about the information in the Help Tab, join one of the Tips and Tricks tours that are scheduled on the <a href="/tappedin/do/CalendarAction?state=displayExtCalendar">calendar of events</a>.  To access the internal calendar which is set to each member's time zone, select the Tapped In tab and then select Calendar in the blue menu bar.
