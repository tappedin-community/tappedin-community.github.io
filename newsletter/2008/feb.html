<h2>[1] Member Perspective: Karen Campbell</h2>
Karen Campbell is the instructional technology supervisor for Harrisonburg City Public Schools in Virginia.  A member since 2003, she uses TI to support professional development for the teachers in her division.<br>  
<br>
<i>Karen's Perspective</i><br>
I've been working with teachers to help them use technology effectively for the past 10 years.  It is exciting to consider how technology has changed during that time and to wonder what may be coming in the next 10 years.  For the past five years I have been involved with Tapped In both as a participant and as a facilitator, and I find it an engaging and effective way for educators to share ideas and resources. <br>
<br>
Through an "Enhancing Education Through Technology" grant, teachers in our area have the opportunity to demonstrate mastery of the National Educational Technology Standards for Teachers (NETS*T) by building an electronic portfolio.  To support teachers in this endeavor, I offer a graduate-level course that focuses on the effective integration of technology to enhance instruction. Tapped In is a great resource to compliment our face-to-face meetings.

<h2>[4] Group Focus of the Month: Learning From Lyrics</h2>
In the <a href="http://www.tolerance.org/teach/activities/activity.jsp?ar=900&ttnewsletter=ttnewsgen-011508">Teaching Tolerance Newsletter</a> on 1/15/08 there was an article compiled by Jeff Sapp about a lyric-based learning program designed by John Chase that helps students analyze songs.<br>
<br>
It's a far more effective approach to teach students how to be critical thinkers and listeners, thus empowering them to make informed choices as consumers of music. <br>
<br>
The critical thinking approach can be applied to any genre of music and helps students to differentiate between songs and identify those lyrics that contain meaningful social and political commentary.<br>
<br>
At the same time, students learn to recognize the destructive power of songs containing excessive profanity and gratuitous lyrics that demean and degrade others and only serve to perpetuate harmful societal prejudices and stereotypes.<br>
<br>
The TI team proudly announces that John Chase, Edmeston Central School, Edmeston, N.Y., is none other than our very own TI member Johnathan Chase who leads the monthly <a href="http://www.learningfromlyrics.org/">Learning From Lyrics</a> discussions!<br>

<h2>[5] Group Focus of the Month: TI Anniversary Scrapbook</h2>
<i>Conference Season and Sustaining Learning</i><br>
As much as TI community members probably wish they could attend all the wonderful professional development conferences that will be taking place around the world the coming year, we know that this is not a realistic option.  Each member does have the option of collaboration however! If you are fortunate enough to attend a conference and have some favorite workshops or keynote speeches that you experienced, please share them with your TI colleagues by scheduling a calendar event (email bjb@tappedin.org) or posting to an existing special interest group discussion board or creating a special interest group with a focus on the topic that piqued your interest. Turn your one-time experience into sustained learning through collaboration, and support the goal of TI to provide its community with best practices for educators.<br> 

<h2>[6] Comenius Course on Web 2.0 and Modern Language Teaching</h2>
In conjunction with the Utrecht University SummerSchool, the Faculties of Education of Heidelberg and Utrecht Universities of Applied Sciences offer a 7-day, international course exploring Web 2.0 applications such as Wiki and Weblogging, real-time communication and the LanguageQuest format for integrating the web into classroom teaching. The course location in the brand-new building of the Faculty of Education in Utrecht allows for demonstration of good practices of and personal training in the use of Interactive WhiteBoards.
