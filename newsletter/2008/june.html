Quote of the Month - "How can it be, in a world where half the things a man knows at 20 are no longer true at 40 -- and half the things he knows at 40 hadn't been discovered when he was 20?" - Arthur C. Clarke (1917 - 2008)</p>

<h2>[1] Tapped In Festival 2008</h2>
The theme for TI Festival 2008 is "Beyond Conflict: Building Peaceful Communities."  This year this ninth annual event has been split into a two half-days: July 23, 2pm-8pm PDT and July 24, 8am-2pm PDT.  The schedule includes keynotes by <a href="http://entertainingdiversity.com/teja.htm">Teja Arboleda</a> and Anna Martin, the driving force behind the <a href="http://cedarnet.org/emig/peace/">Blanket the World with Peace</a> project. There will be a new group created for global collaboration on multicultural trading cards during the Festival. Linda Ullah will discuss Global Projects to Help Those in Need and Lesley Farmer will discuss Global e-Citizens.  Watch for the Festival Flyer, which can be used as a handout for colleagues, coming soon. The flyer will be posted on the <a href="/tappedin/web/festival/">Festival web page</a> which is also linked in Tapped In Reception and on our homepage.<br>
<br>
<i>Certificates of Participation</i><br>
Certificates will be available for participants for who register for three events (may include ONE Pre-Festival Tour).  Registration is done online at the conclusion of each event. (Continuing Education Credits for the certificates are determined by individual educational institutions.)  Certificates for volunteers and presenters will also be available.<br>

<h2>[2] Natural Disaster Help Center</h2>
The Natural Disaster Help Center was created after Hurricane Katrina. Since then folders have been added to the group room to allow TI members to seek assistance and offer assistance to victims from natural disasters that have occurred all over the world. The latest folder is for those affected by the flooding in the U.S. Midwest states.  During the TI Festival 2008 Linda Ullah will be leading a discussion on Global Projects to Help Those in Need. Do you have some ideas for ways to help or want to get your students involved in meaningful projects? Join the Natural Disaster Help Center group and post your questions and suggestions to the discussion board, then come to the Festival and watch your ideas become reality!<br>

<h2>[3] Tips and Comments from the Experts</h2>
During a recent Tips and Tricks, TI member Kevin Jacoves made the astute observation that, "This [Tapped In] runs on communication--it's pretty much the whole point of the community."<br>

<h2>[5] Tapped In Technology Tip</h2>
<i>Discussion Boards</i><br>
Discussion boards are asynchronous ways in which groups can communicate. They are similar to email groups in that a post to a room discussion board is emailed to each member of the group or subscriber to that discussion board.  Every room in TI has a discussion board.  This includes the public conference rooms, group rooms, private offices and Tapped In Reception.  Only group members are subscribed to a group room discussion board, but any member can subscribe to the public room discussion boards and the discussion board in Reception.  Groups are encouraged to post to their group discussion boards because the topics may be sensitive or not applicable to all TI members.  Public Conference Room and Reception discussion boards are more suitable for generic education topics.  For example, if you have a question for special educators, you will direct your query to those best qualified to answer if you join the Special Education Forum and post to that group discussion board.  If an instructor requires you to post responses to a course topic, those posts should be made in the instructor's group room (or office, if no group room was provided) unless the instructor feels that all TI members may be interested in and benefit from your comments and thus require you to post to a public discussion board.
