Quote of the Month: "In an effective classroom students should not only know what they are doing, they should also know why and how." - Harry Wong</p>

<h2>[1] Member Perspective: Sharon Hurwitz</h2>
<i>Meet Sharon</i><br>
Sharon Hurwitz is a Technology Consultant who retired from Hampton City Schools and is currently an online facilitator for PBSTeacherLine and the Virginia Community of Anytime Knowledge.<br>
<br>
<i>Sharon's Perspective</i><br>
I was introduced to Tapped In through the PBSTeacherLine Capstone Program.  When I became one of their coaches, I expanded my use.  Not only do we use it in professional development to teach teachers a Free and Safe way to communicate with students, but we use it to communicate with our Capstone Coaches.  <br> 
<br>
I also used it when I became the Technology Instructor at the NASA Pre-Service Teacher Institute.  I developed a room where pre-service teachers from around the country could quickly and easily communicate with each other and collect files and resources.  The physical Institute only lasts two weeks each summer, and this venue keeps the discussion going after they get back to their university.  Then, when they start teaching, they still have access to the materials and each other.  <br>
<br>
It is especially helpful that, whenever we introduce Tapped In to teachers, there is always help there to guide them to the right spot and to answer questions for them.  My favorite feature to highlight is the calendar of activities.  I insist that teachers check out the calendar and pick one event to participate in ~ they almost always start with the Tips and Tricks event ~ which is great because then they get a broader understanding of what Tapped In can do.<br>
<br>
Because I am no longer directly involved with students, I have not actually used the Student Campus of Tapped In but that is also one of the features I highlight with teachers.  Knowing that you can make your "room" private is a powerful tool to help keep our students safe.<br>

<h2>[2] Tips and Comments from the Experts</h2>
Dolores Guittar, who is participating along with her teachers in the TI: Learning Hub, posted this response to the discussion board reflective writing prompt on learning about the Extended Capabilities of Tapped In - <br>
<br>
"I keep "plugging away" with Tapped In.  I have learned how to use and used all of the extended capabilities that are listed. [There is a list of pre-requisites needed for participation in the Learning Hub group room.]  I have an office, own a group, know how to feature notes, links, etc. and have established passageways out of my group rooms.<br>
<br>
I have been entering Tapped In just about every day now for some time. Many times, I just explore what is available and then go back and give BJB all my questions!  Sometimes I play around and decorate my office or my classroom.<br>
<br>
Because of my "explorations" I have found many useful links that I have added to my own classroom, links that I will use with my students.  I have really come to like the chat as I get responses right away from the experts.  Those experts can be the TI helpdesk folks or experts within the group in which I am participating."<br>

<h2>[5] Tapped In Technology Tip</h2>
<i>Discussion Boards (cont'd) </i><br>
Last month, Discussion boards were discussed as a way in which all members of a group can communicate asynchronously.  Something that was not covered then is that when a Tapped In member joins a group, that member is automatically subscribed to the discussion board in that group room.  This is the reason it is recommended that, if you join the TI: Learning Hub group and are interested in submitting reflective writing to the discussion board in the TI: Learning Hub, you may want to "unsubscribe" from the discussion board so you are not flooded with posts from Learning Hub participants. Unsubscribing does not remove you from the group, just stops you from getting an email each time someone posts to the discussion board. This tip is applicable to all TI Groups and is one way to reduce the number of email messages that you get from TI.<br>
