<h2>[1] Nings, tweets, and wikis, oh my!</h2>
Nings, tweets, and wikis, oh my!  It seems that the opportunities to communicate online increase exponentially daily. Participation in the many educational environments tends to fragment focus and learning. At some point it might be a good idea for us to stop and consider what we're doing and why we're doing it.  If we put all online resources for educators through a Bloom's taxonomy, are we creating opportunities for professional development in this hierarchy of thinking skills?  How do we and our students learn? Does learning now take place at hyper-speed because we can access more information more quickly?  Can you apply this information gathering to make use of the knowledge you have accessed?  As you choose the online professional development environment that best fits your teaching style and your learning style, are you being engaged in analysis, synthesis and evaluation?  Do you have the opportunity to brainstorm, argue, assess, verify information?<br>
<br>
Have you looked at the Tapped In calendar of events lately? Is there an event on the calendar that applies to your discipline? Can you use this opportunity to meet with colleagues to delve into how you can provide the higher order thinking skills that are needed in your classroom?  If you don't see anything relevant to your discipline, or the time isn't right or you have a different idea of how to present a topic, be proactive!  The calendar is community driven.  Members volunteer their time to present topics they feel would be useful to other members... either for professional development or as classroom support.  But, the community must support these volunteer efforts for them to be of any value.  If you have any input on this topic, whether you are a teacher educator or a classroom teacher, join the Proactive Educators group and give some feedback. By joining the group you can use the asynchronous discussion board, a feature that is one way to overcome the time issue with which we all struggle!<br>

<h2>[2] NortelLearniT to Present Mini-Expo</h2>
Instead of the marathon 12 hour Tapped In Festival, this year a 3 hour mini expo is being planned.  Sharon Bowers and Michael Connet from <a href="http://nortellearnit.org/ ">NortelLearniT</a> joined BJ Berquist and Dianne Allen to start planning for Tapped In Mini-Expo 2009. The time frame will probably be the 3rd or 4th week of August.  Volunteers will be needed to help with pre-mini-expo Tips and Tricks. Join the TI Mini Expo group if you'd like to participate in future planning discussions.<br>
<br>
Some of the brainstorming topics discussed were:<br>
<br>
*  Start with the proposition that 21st Century e-Teaching involves activities and skills that can be acquired and ensure success for participants. <br>
*  Discuss how the use of social media change the ways we think about identity, community, and interpersonal communication.<br>
*  What should participants "walk away" with after participating? <br>
*  Demonstrate that within the social media learning community participants are being supported by their peers... not in competition with them.<br>
*  Give participants a flavor of some of the resources/training that NortelLearniT 21 eTeacher  contains, but within the context of learning to use a tool for instructional activities that could be used in their teaching.<br>
*  Show module example about social media and how can it be used in education. <br>
*  Acknowledge that the user community of teachers have unique needs and expertise... and, by using online tools (e.g. twitter) to communicate what participants know and need.<br>
*  Collaboration, using new tools one such resource is 21st century e-Teacher, is an important approach to developing those skills.<br>
*  It's important to stress how participants can become part of the collaborative community.<br>
*  Provide a better understanding of the NortelLearniT resources.<br>
*  Provide opportunities for participants to take some ownership of the content.<br>
*  Identify where content can be extended and continue to build ideas for best practice.<br>
*  Participants would leave this Tapped In mini-expo being excited to put to work a skill that they learned from the 21st Century e-Teacher.<br>
*  One concept of the mini-expo is about micro-blogging... so the first part of the expo should make sure that participants have a clear understanding of the purpose and method, and to do that within Twitter.<br>
*  Participants, through engagement in the Tapped In mini-expo, can become an "advisory" group for NortelLearniT.<br>

<h2>[3] News Nuggets</h2>
David J. Rosen, owner of the Adult Education Online group in TI, shares this information: The Adult Literacy Online Professional Development (ALOPD) Work Group has created a set of guidelines for state and national adult literacy education groups that want to offer - or improve their practice in - online professional development, especially to help classroom teachers learn how to teach online and in blended online and face-to-face learning situations. It may also be useful for others interested in OPD. The document is available in PDF in two parts: <a href="http://home.comcast.net/~djrosen/Design_Elements.pdf">Part 1</a> and <a href="http://home.comcast.net/~djrosen/Design_Elements.1.pdf">Part 2</a>.<br>
<br>
The ALOPD is a spin-off of the National Institute for Literacy/Association of Adult Literacy Professional Developers discussion list. It's a work group of over 20 people from the U.S. and Canada who offer adult literacy professional development online. For more information about ALOPD contact David at DJRosen @ theworld.com<br>
