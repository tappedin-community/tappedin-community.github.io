<h2>[1] Tips and Comments from the Experts</h2>
A special Tapped In thanks to Dolores Guittar and her teachers for their participation in the Learning Hub Series! Dolores writes in a reflective post to the Learning Hub group discussion board:<br>
<br>
I fully understand the idea of seat mentality to which you refer.  This is such a new experience for my teachers that I believe that is where we are.  <br>
<br>
Tapped In offers the opportunity to communicate. Not just with the educators with whom one works, but educators from all over the world - coming together to share learning experiences -be they successes or failures.  It is a community of learners.  Tapped In also promotes the learning of new ways of using technology in the classroom - using free programs that many teachers have never even heard of.  And TI is not just promoting, Tapped In provides ways to learn those new programs and support in doing just that.<br>
<br>
Teachers can work through the sessions offered under Learning Hub throughout the year and then talk about and show what they have done with technology in their own classroom toward the end of the school year, thereby letting other educators see and learn from their experience and getting additional feedback from the rest of the community of learners. <br>
<br>
Tapped In is an excellent Profession Development program!<br>

<h2>[2] Next Vista for Learning Sonnets & Multimedia Project</h2>
<a href="http://NextVista.org">Next Vista for Learning</a> is a free, online library of short, educational videos by and for teachers and students everywhere. The videos are designed to help kids learn topics that challenge them, better understand the larger world, and appreciate the joy and meaning of service to others. <br>
<br>
In celebration of the 400th anniversary of the publication of Shakespeare's Sonnets, we at NextVista.org are running a project encouraging young people everywhere to share their insights on these poems. Those interested in participating in the project are invited to create a video centered on any one of Shakespeare's 154 sonnets. For more information see <a href="http://nextvista.org/projects/Project-Sonnets_and_Multimedia.pdf">NextVista video submission rules</a>.<br>
<br>
This project is a prime example of how Tapped In can be used as a Learning Hub to extend teaching and learning opportunities.  Rushton Hurley leads a Next Vista for Learning discussion in Tapped In on the first Thursday of the month. If you have any questions, contact him at rh@nextvista.org <br>

<h2>[3] News Nuggets</h2>

Kim Foley is revising her book, "The Big Pocket Guide to Using & Creating Virtual Field Trips" and will include a new section on educators' experiences of using VFTs with their students.  Kim is looking for stories about how you've used VFTs. The following, are meant as idea stimulators:<br>
 <br>
* How has the use of VFTs enhanced (or not) the learning experience?<br>
* What are the benefits of a VFT versus an on-site trip?<br>
* What is the impact of budget cuts on your on site field trips and have VFTs served to provide a reasonable substitute?<br>
* Have you found that VFTs aid the curiosity of your students for further exploration beyond the trip itself?<br>
* Have you created games or projects around the VFTs?<br>
* Do your students work individually or in groups?<br>
<br>
If you have a story that you'd be interested in sharing for the revision, please submit to:kim@tramline.com <br>

<h2>[4] Tapped In Technology Tip</h2>
<i>K-12 Student Resource Rooms</i><br>
If you have an idea or a request for a K-12 Student Resource Room, be a proactive TI community member! Each TI  member is greatly valued for what he/she can contribute to OUR community. Do you have expertise in a subject or discipline that you would like to share with the K-12 Students and Teachers? K-12 Resource Rooms are like classrooms, but they contain lesson plan ideas, research topics and links to resources that extend the depth of this safe and secure student environment. These classrooms are set to allow all visitors, but, since the room is in the student campus, only TI members can enter the room.  A teacher can ask to collaborate with a resource room owner so that his/her students are then able to enter that room and do their own research by accessing the resources available.  To see an example of a Student Resource Room visit the K-12 Student Campus and the NASA Resources room that Sharon Bowers has created. For more information participate in one of the Tips and Tricks Learning Hub events or join Jeff Cooper for his K-12 Classroom Support and Collaboration discussion. <br>
<br>
<i>[Note to Professors of Pre-service teachers: This would make a great assignment for your students! The room could serve as a 'portfolio' that could be updated as the teacher gains experience. BJB]</i><br>
