Quote of the Month - "One of the hardest tasks of leadership is understanding that you are not what you are, but what you're perceived to be by others." --Edward L. Flom, CEO of Florida Steel
</p>

<h2>[1] RealWorld-InWorld NASA Engineering Design Challenge</h2>

<p>Registration is OPEN for RealWorld-InWorld (RWIW), NASA's engineering design challenge. Face-to-face and virtual reality experiences related to the James Webb Space Telescope and Robonaut 2 will be the basis for the middle and high school challenge. See <a href="http://www.nasarealworldinworld.org/">the RealWorld-InWorld web site</a>.</p>

<p>RWIW is well-suited for formal and informal educational groups (e.g., teachers, home schoolers, etc.). Free, flexible online educational resources can easily be used to develop an activity, after school science/robotics camp, or unit study for middle and high school youth (teens). These materials guide teachers and sponsoring adults through the challenge so their teams may submit their final project solutions.</p>

<p>If you have questions, contact the RWIW project manager, Sharon Bowers, at rwiw@nianet.org</p>

<h2>[2] Tapped In Calendar of Events Up & Running!</h2>

<p>As if the above announcement about RWIW isn't exciting enough, Sharon Bowers is leading a virtual tour of this project via Tapped In on October 12! The Tapped In calendar is chock full of great PD opportunities. Take some of the stress out of back-to-school by meeting with other community members to collaborate. To view the calendar in your time zone log in to Tapped In and select the Tapped In tab at the top of the web window. Then select Calendar in the blue menu bar.  All the calendar events are free and are led by leaders in the education field (see Lesley Farmer's News Nugget, below). In addition to providing updates in their various fields of expertise, all the presenters give you the opportunity to ask questions and suggest topics for discussion. Fabulous discussions that are personalized to your needs and a transcript to boot! What more can an educator ask for?!</p>

<h2>[3] News Nuggets</h2>

Tapped In member, Cybrarian, and ISTE MS discussion leader Lesley Farmer had a busy summer. She's trying to finish writing her book on library services to youth with autism, received an ALA award for contributions to library education, and presented at Comic-Con about libraries and graphic novels from a research perspective. In addition, the California School Library Association is co-branding Lesley's Digital Citizenship training modules, and they won the International Association of School Librarianship Library Innovation award for it! To keep up with Lesley (wear your track shoes!), see <a href="http://k12digitalcitizenship.wikispaces.com">Lesley's K12 Digital Citizenship Wiki</a>.
