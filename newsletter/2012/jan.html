<h2>[1] Tapped In is Off and Running in 2012!</h2>

<p>After a long holiday break that, hopefully, gave everyone time to recharge and renew commitments to education and learning, the Tapped In Calendar of Events up and running. January events begin on the 9th with the Special Education Forum. K-12 Language Arts and the K to 3 Great Resources are scheduled for January 10, a special Webheads EVO tour of Tapped In will be held on January 11, and the always inspiring WriteTalk is on January 12. Check the calendar for events scheduled for the rest of January and take advantage of these opportunities to collaborate with colleagues and learn from the fabulous experts who volunteer to lead these discussions!</p>

<h2>[4] Comments from the Experts</h2>

Here's another example of a Tapped In member (Peter Kronfeld) collaborating with one of the TI discussion leaders (Math Transformers, Patricia Chen).
<br>
PeterK: I'm doing part-time subbing as a Special Ed and Child Development assistant.<br>
PatriciaCh: do you help with instruction?<br>
PeterK: Usually I'm helping special needs students work on assignments, worksheets etc.<br>
PatriciaCh: ok ...<br>
PeterK: That's the problem.  Typical students aren't highly motivated by worksheets.  SPED kids even less so.<br>
PeterK: That's why I participate in these Tapped In discussions.... to get ideas for more engaging lessons.
<br>--------------------<br>
Tapped In member Alisha Comick had some meaningful dialogue with Susan Roseman, who leads the K to 3 Resources discussion, and BJ Berquist, a Tapped In helpdesk volunteer. 
<br>
AlishaC: I like the discussion. I was supplied with resources in real time. Which is totally different from my online class.<br>
BjB: when you no longer have online classes, Tapped In gives you colleagues with whom you can collaborate<br>
SusanR nods<br>
AlishaC: It's like an online dialogue. Collaborate is big! Collaborating with you guys helped me and my students.<br>
BjB smiles happily<br>
BjB: may I quote you on that, Alisha?<br>
AlishaC: I'm all about sharing ideas because someone may have an answer too.

Tapped In member Wendy Quinones responded to a post to the Playing to Learn group discussion board. (The discussion boards are an asynchronous way for groups to communicate and collaborate, even if the group does not meet for real time discussions!)
<br>
WendyQ: Hey BJ!<br>
BjB waves hi to Wendy!<br>
WendyQ: Just wanted to thank you for that article on making curriculum in video game style!<br>
WendyQ: I haven't read it yet, but it is just what I have been puzzling over for a long time.<br>
BjB: you're welcome :-)<br>
WendyQ: I've printed it and some of its cousins and will read it over lunch<br>
WendyQ: I think Playing to Learn meets on one of my teaching nights, unfortunately<br>
BjB: Playing to Learn doesn't have real time chats...<br>
WendyQ: Oh<br>
BjB: I post to the discussion board.<br>
WendyQ: So there's stuff up there?<br>
BjB: but, if you'd like to help me plan a chat, that would be fun<br>
BjB: yes, tons of posts on the discussion board...and in the links and files<br>
WendyQ: That would be! Let me read the articles and refresh myself with Jim Gee's book.<br>
BjB nods<br>
WendyQ: And I'll check out the board.<br>
WendyQ: Remember I teach adults, so it's a bit different than most<br>
WendyQ: But the principles are the same
<br>--------------------<br>
Tapped In member Carmen Degabriele used the discussion board in Reception to post a greatly appreciated thank you note! 
<br>
Through this discussion I would like to thank BjB for the help and patience with which she tackled my chat and for the support she gave me when I asked her questions.<br>
Thanks, CarmenD
