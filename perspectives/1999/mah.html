<h2>Michael's Perspective</h2>

Why I Like TAPPED IN.
<br>
(or, why MOOing isn't just for cows)
<br><br>
I've used, and completely enjoyed TAPPED IN since January, 1998.  When I started, I didn't have 
an idea that I would use it as often as I do, or that I would find it as important a resource 
as I do.  Not only do I use it personally in order to interact with other educational professionals, 
but I've also used it as a classroom resource and have used it to help other teachers see the power 
of Internet connectivity.  TAPPED IN has allowed me to be able to interact and know people not just 
locally, but nationwide and worldwide as well.  For me, that makes TAPPED IN a great asset.  I 
just wish more people in my school district utilized TAPPED IN, and one of my resolutions for 1999 
is to use it more myself.
<br><br>
In a way, it's like an ensemble television show like the long-running show, M*A*S*H, for example.  
In that show, several people from varied backgrounds and geographic areas were brought together 
for one purpose, to work in a field hospital during the Korean War.  Yet, in the middle of all 
of that, the characters not only saw each other as important professionally, they saw each other 
as important personally.  They became a sort of informal family, and were just as close knit as 
if they were related by blood.  In my experience, I've been able to participate professionally, 
but also been able to make many close friends through just being online in TAPPED IN.
<br><br>
In my own experience, I've been a host, or co-host, of several After School Online sessions, was 
a participant in the 1998 Civil Rights Forum, and have on several occasions, conducted office 
hours for ED's Oasis.  All of this is a great professional experience for me, and I'm glad to 
be part of the TAPPED IN family!
