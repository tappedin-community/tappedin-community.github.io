<h1>Tapped In Member Perspectives: Meet Nancy Haas</h1>

<a href="http://hale.pepperdine.edu/~nwhaas/index.htm">Nancy Haas</a> (NancyWH online) is a 
technology resource teacher in San Juan Capistrano, California 
and teaches Technology and Career Exploration to 9th graders at Aliso Niguel High School. 
She has been a member of TAPPED IN since she joined in Summer 1998 as a graduate student in 
Pepperdine University's Online Masters in Educational Technology. 
Nancy loves to snuggle up with a feline, chocolate chip cookies and a cup of hot java. 
She rejuvenates with shiatsu deep tissue massage and is eager to learn it - after she completes her 
Master's! Her excitement about the possibilities that TAPPED IN can open to colleagues in her 
district are apparent in her Perspective ...

<h2>Nancy's Perspective</h2>

TAPPED IN Bridges the Gap
<br><br>
With the recent reduction and elimination of release days for professional growth in California, 
the staff development department of Capistrano U.S.D. was faced with the challenge of providing 
4500 teachers over an area of 195 square miles with quality professional development. The district 
decided to schedule workshops around the school year in the areas of technology, curriculum, 
literacy and standards and provide a financial incentive for teachers to attend. I saw these 
workshops as an opportunity to demonstrate how TAPPED IN can help teachers develop their own 
community of practice. 
<br><br>
The resource people at TAPPED IN, including Terry Gray, Hulda Nystrom, and Judi Fusco, assisted 
me in planning and presenting two sessions for a Saturday workshop. My first objective was for my 
colleagues to feel comfortable with the environment; my primary goal was to introduce them to the 
resources available at this site. By keeping the number of participants small, I was able to provide 
support for those who had never experienced a MOO or MUVE. Once all had logged in, I asked them to 
tell me something about themselves, their school and their classes. I then provided them with a 
list of activities and resources for foreign languages, English, math, science and history that are 
available in TAPPED IN. 
<br><br>
At the conclusion of the workshop I asked participants to complete a survey of their level of 
technology, their impression of the experience, and how they might use this resource at their 
schools. The responses were overwhelmingly positive, yet only one teacher has since pursued 
the use of TAPPED IN. 
<br><br>
According to Dr. Talley, whom we encountered at the Connect School Conference in Anaheim, 
providing sustained support and innovation, legitimate resources, feedback, functionality,
and expert help are some of the key elements found in an effective staffing agenda. My workshop 
did not provide all of these components, but I realized that just as I had been mentored in 
learning to use TAPPED IN, I in turn needed to mentor my colleagues. To this end I've started 
a newsletter, "The Capo Tech Times", to introduce my colleagues to ideas and pedagogy relating 
to technology.
<br><br>
I am also working with our district's technology mentor teachers and the Director of Technology 
Instruction Services to bridge the barriers of time and distance using TAPPED IN to facilitate 
communication among them. This approach will enable us to access the support, innovation, 
resources, feedback, functionality, and expert help recommended by Dr. Sue Talley of Pepperdine 
University to promote an environment of "sustained cognitive and interactive support", of which 
TAPPED IN is a key component.
