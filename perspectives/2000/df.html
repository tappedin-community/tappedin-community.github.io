<h1>Tapped In Member Perspectives: Meet David Fish</h1>

David Fish teaches computers at Summit Day Center in Santa Ana, California.  Summit Day 
Center is an alternative school for juvenile offenders.  The student body is comprised 
of students who have violated laws and been expelled from their regular school districts.  
David taught science for the first twelve years at Summit.  Upon finishing his Master's 
degree in Educational Technology from Pepperdine University, luck would have it that the 
Summit computer teacher transferred to another school, creating an opening for David.

<h2>David's Perspective</h2>

Like many others I joined TAPPED IN as part of my Master's Degree in Educational Technology 
from Pepperdine University.  Prior to my joining TAPPED IN on September 12, 1998, I belonged 
to the Pepperdine University MOO, but it was limited.  Because of Dr. Polin's vision, Pepperdine 
became a partner organization with TAPPED IN.  We all joined and soon discovered the vastly
enhanced capabilities of the TAPPED IN MUVE.
<br><br>
After finishing Pepperdine I took a break and soon discovered I suffered from 
collaboration-separation anxiety; BJB calls it plain old TI withdrawal.  Teachers, especially 
those working in Alternative/Correctional Education are often isolated from their peers.  
It was even more so for me as I began applying what I learned at Pepperdine to my own practice.  
My peers had no clue to what I was talking about when I would go on about Communities of
Practice and collaboration in a constructivist environment.  My isolation grew so I logged 
back into TI one Saturday hoping to run into someone from my Pepperdine Cadre or a former 
professor.  It didn't happen.  I sort of missed the close association I had come to know 
working with one group over a sustained period of time. Like so many others, when I logged 
back in I ran into BJB.  What a treat!  As I learned, BJ also teaches in Correctional Education. 
Most importantly I learned how little I knew about functioning in the TAPPED IN environment.
<br><br>
BJ's warm and friendly enthusiasm hooked me back into TI.  Soon it was time to remodel my office 
and expand my abilities in the TI environment. An online graduate program doesn't require any real 
significant MOO knowledge; about three commands does it.  It wasn't long till I found a home.  
To participate in this environment is both stimulating and exciting.  It's an extension of my 
graduate work but on a much broader scale due to the worldwide membership.  Now my family is 
spread all over the country and globe.  In my district, which is sizable as it includes all of 
Orange County California, the technology leadership is somewhat fractured.  It is my hope to 
lure all of the techies into the TAPPED IN loop for the betterment of our professional existence
 but most of all for the betterment of our students.
<br><br>
I have had the pleasure of being a volunteer on theTAPPED IN help desk for the last six months.  
With the patience of Saints, BJ, Judi Fusco, Mark Schlager, Chuck Merritt and HunterG have all 
helped me develop my skills enough to volunteer at the "Help Desk". Also, I co-host the 
Alternative/Correctional Education Discussion Group on the third Thursday of each month with 
BJ Berquist.
