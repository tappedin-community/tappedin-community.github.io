<h1>Tapped In Member Perspectives: Meet Phil Harrison</h1>

Phil Harrison (aka PhilH) is Manager of Educational Programs at 
<a href="http://www.computermaster.com">Computer Master Institute</a> of 
New Media and Internet Technologies, in Victoria, BC Canada.
He has been involved with the school since its inception in 1995, both as a trainer 
and a coordinator of training. In addition to working full time, Phil is busy completing 
his Masters of Business Administration in Digital Technologies Management at
<a href="http://www.royalroads.ca">Royal Roads University</a> In fact, he is so busy that 
he often neglects his social duties (logging in and chatting with the folks at TAPPED IN) 
but he is trying very hard to reform his life.

<h2>Phil's Perspective</h2>

I discovered TAPPED IN in July 1999 during a personal search for MUD-like communities with 
a focus on education. The search eventually led to TAPPED IN. From the moment I logged in 
I knew I was "home".  I immediately applied for a membership, then went in as a guest to 
look around. BJ Berquist, who had been a member for a year and a half, greeted me. You would 
think by the extent of her knowledge that she actually built the place. (Editor's note:  
no way!  BJB)  Before the first day was over I had an office and was beginning to experiment 
with objects. After a few weeks I began to expand with other rooms and to experiment with 
ASCII graphics.  Eventually I learned how to do room graphics and . . . well, come and visit
W1215 anytime to see how it all evolved.  I have experienced many pleasant and informative 
get-togethers with my collaboratives at TAPPED IN.  Becoming a member here has not only been 
enjoyable and instructive but also a defining experience; it has given me a very real sense 
of belonging to a global community. You might even say I have become an evangelist for 
TAPPED IN. Everyone I meet who has even a remote connection to the field of education receives 
a prolonged discourse on the benefits of membership.
