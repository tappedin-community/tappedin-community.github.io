<h2>Donna's Perspective</h2>

I have been online now for 10 years this coming fall.  It's a long time to be using 
chats of any form.  It has always been, for me, a place to find people who are 
like-minded.  I'm reminded of L.M. Montgomery's character, Anne Shirley, who once said,
"Kindred Spirits are not so scarce as I used to think.  It's splendid to find out 
there are so many of them in the world."  I had an inkling of what could be done 
with this technology, educationally speaking, and for years had asked around if 
anyone had heard of, or would be interested in using it as a forum for education.
<br><br>
Then one summer afternoon I read though my e-mail and found an invitation from Michael 
Hutchinson to a Social Studies Forum at TAPPED IN.  I have always had an interest 
in Social Studies, but my main focus had always been English and Elementary Education.  
I decided it might be interesting and attended.  I logged in and low and behold, here 
was what I had been looking for and talking about for the past 4 years!  A group of 
people who understood the educational value of technology and who were continually 
striving to work it into their teaching, regardless of limitations they might feel.
<br><br>
I have met so many people at TAPPED IN who work as many of us wish education would - 
without politics, and everyone working toward a common goal.  Everyone is on equal 
footing and has something useful to share, and everyone else is willing to listen.  
There is room to grow and learn.  TAPPED IN has a true community spirit and is full 
of positive energy, joyful purpose, and a gratefulness of its chosen profession.  
My only question is, why did it take me so long to find it?
