<h1>Tapped In Member Perspectives: Meet William Wilson</h1>

William is currently a science teacher and technology coordinator for Richmond Hill 
HS in New York City.  He is also the forum coordinator for TAPPED IN's Technology 
Coordinator's and Science Teacher's Forums. 

<h2>William's Perspective</h2>

Having grown up around computers (my first memory of them is 
playing in the card sorting room at the Harvard computing center in 
about 1958), I see them as tools to be used to improve the quality of 
life.  As tools we need to recognize what the strengths and 
weaknesses are and so how best, and when best, to use them for 
our own improvement and for our student's growth.
<br><br>
TAPPED IN provides a resource that extends my working community from a 
few teachers within my school to a world wide community involving 
some of the most active, intelligent, and resourceful teachers and 
educators.  By coordinating the Science Teacher and Tech Coordinator's 
Forums at TAPPED IN, I can give back a little to this community as I use it.
