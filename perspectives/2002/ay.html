<h1>Tapped In Member Perspectives: Meet Aiden Yeh</h1>

Aiden (AidenY) teaches EFL in Shih Chien University and National Kaoshiung First 
University of Science and Technology.  She received her MS degree in ELT 
(English Language Teaching) Management from the University of Surrey and TESOL 
Certificate from University of Leicester.  She is an active member of TESOL 
and IATEFL and a die-hard Webhead. (Webheads is an online community of students 
and teachers who have been communicating and interacting since 1989.)

<h2>Aiden's Perspective</h2>

I cannot remember exactly the first time I visited TAPPED IN. However, I am pretty 
sure that it was Vance Stevens (the man behind Webheads) who introduced me to 
TAPPED IN. At that time, both Vance and I were moderating our own respective EV 
online sessions (see 
<a href="http://groups.yahoo.com/groups/evonline">http://groups.yahoo.com/groups/evonline</a>). 
I joined Vance's session, "Webheads in Action: Community formation online and its 
role in language learning" (see 
<a href="http://groups.yahoo.com/group/evonline2002_webheads">http://groups.yahoo.com/group/evonline2002_webheads</a>) 
and I was hooked right away, not only to the use of technology, but also the 
people that make the community alive and vibrant. Webheads meet regularly online
every Sunday, 12 noon GMT and these meetings are held at TAPPED IN.  It was at 
one of those special meetings with the other Webheads when I got to learn more 
about TAPPED IN and meet the people behind the helpdesk (BJ, KeikoS, and SusanneN) 
who were/are always there for newbies like me.
<br><br>
As I became more familiar and confident in using TAPPED IN I realized the value of 
this extraordinary site and what it can do for EFL learners.  I must admit, I was 
a bit apprehensive to introduce TAPPED IN to my communication skills class because 
this class does not fall exactly under CALL, therefore, I cannot make this online 
activity compulsory for all my students.  My biggest hurdle was how to implement 
the use of technology without having to use computers in the classroom. Nevertheless, 
I was determined to explore TAPPED IN and make use of it as a tool to empower my 
students - to become self-driven and motivated language learners.  One of the goals 
of this class is to enhance students' conversational skills.  Class discussions 
allow students to speak up, but this kind of traditional setting is no longer enough.  
And what better way to ask my students to practice their communication skills but 
to communicate with people other than their classmates?  The environment in 
TAPPED IN may be virtual, but the discussion and chats and the people participating 
in it are real.
<br><br>
Speaking of discussions, topics are assigned based on the lesson plan and the 
materials that we are using in class. I ask my students to interview the Webheads 
who are in TAPPED IN and try to get the necessary information and opinions of others 
by asking questions relevant to the topic.  They print out a copy of the transcripts 
that they have to bring to class the next day for review and to correct the mistakes 
(grammar, etc) they made.  I ask them to talk about what they have gathered from 
the chat and whatever personal insights they may have about the previous session.
<br><br>
What did my students say about their experience using TAPPED IN?  Here are some of 
their comments:
<br>
<ul>
  <li>"BUT, here is really a little bit crowded, and the screen changing too fast"</li>
  <li>"perhaps my typing speed will boost someday"</li>
  <li>"Boy! It's too fast!  Hard to catch on!"</li>
</ul>
Comments such as these, as well as the interactions evident in their transcripts, 
showed we had successfully created a viable social context within TAPPED IN that 
supplemented the classroom. We will be in TAPPED IN again this year.
<br><br>
On the other hand, my students also realize the benefits of such environment to 
learning English.  Let my students speak for themselves:
<br>
<ul>
  <li>"Thank you to tell us this place that we can talk in English!"</li>
  <li>"I think I enjoy here more..."</li>
  <li>"We can practice English and learn how to communicate with people more..."</li>
</ul>
Well, there is always a first to everything, but certainly the first chat we had 
was not the last.  Those who participate online get extra marks for their efforts 
and contributions.  Some of my students have been going to TAPPED IN at their own 
time and free will.  This kind of initiative and personal determination to improve 
their English communication skills, with little or without teacher assistance, is 
evidence that such goals can be achieved. As a teacher, this kind of student
development gives me a sense of fulfillment.  I give them options and show them 
various ways of learning.  The path that they take is of their own choosing.  
This is the time when I have to let go.  I must say, that I could not have done it 
and would not be in this state of nirvana without the Webheads and the TAPPED IN 
HelpDesk volunteers.
