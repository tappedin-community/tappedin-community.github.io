<h1>Tapped In Member Perspectives: Meet Jan Friesen</h1>

Jan is an Instructional Support Specialist for the eMINTS program in Missouri. 
She helps a group of teachers in Missouri with integration of technology. Most 
of the teachers work in 3rd and 4th grade classes. She has been a member of 
TAPPED IN since 1999.

<h2>Jan's Perspective</h2>

I can't remember when I first stumbled into TAPPED IN.  I'm sure it was sometime 
when I was working on my Masters in Educational Technology at the University of 
Missouri-Columbia.  When I first visited it was too much for me.  I had heard 
of MUVEs and MUDs, but I could not imagine spending the time it would take to 
learn to use one.  I knew that feeling comfortable with TAPPED IN was important, 
so I forced myself to log in now and then and wander around.  What helped me 
the most as I gradually became comfortable with TAPPED IN was that there was 
always a real person at the Reception Desk.  The helpful and friendly BJB, the 
paint palette, was there almost every time I came.  I could immediately get 
answers to my questions.  Over time I think that interface also improved which 
made getting around easier. Directions on how to do many of the things I wanted 
to do were available with the click of the mouse.
<br><br>
It probably took me a year or more to be able to remember my password and to 
think about going into TAPPED IN more often.  I think what got me going 
regularly was the WebQuest sessions with Bernie Dodge.  He has visited Missouri 
a few times and so it was nice to be able to keep learning with him and others.  
These WebQuest sessions were my first experiences of being in a chat room.  At 
first it was frustrating.  The conversation is not linear and it takes time to 
learn to follow them.  Many students are used to this type of disjointed 
communication and it does not bother them.  It is important for educators to 
learn to use this well.
<br><br>
Gradually I learned more and attached a picture of an elephant to my identity 
(elephants never forget) and set up an office.  I also added a cat, a coffee 
maker, a couch and a vending machine that dispenses chocolate. Fluffy was 
hungry, so I had to learn to feed her.  Kari, who was at the reception desk at 
the time, even came to my office to help me learn how.  The fact that I could 
humanize this computer environment amused me and it was not difficult to do.  
I would like to customize the look of my office, but decided that the learning 
curve and time it would take is not worth it for me.  Stop by my office sometime 
to say "HI" (1506W).  If I am not there you can leave me a note on the Whiteboard!
<br><br>
Years have passed since I stumbled in, but I keep on trying and learning. Now I 
always remember my username and password.  I am recognizing some of the same 
names in the After School Online sessions and thinking about the next step. 
I work with elementary school teachers. The goal of our statewide program in 
Missouri is to integrate technology in student-centered inquiry-based ways 
(<a href="http://emints.more.net">http://emints.more.net</a>).  The ultimate 
goal is to enhance student learning and we are seeing some terrific results. 
I also guide a few courses for Connected University.  I have begun to share 
TAPPED IN with teachers that I am working with and also to use my office 
for Office House with Connected University.  I am hoping that it will become 
a useful virtual meeting place in the near future.
