<h1>Tapped In Member Perspectives: Meet Ken Decroo</h1>

Ken Decroo is a middle school science teacher and a professor in the Department 
of Education, Science, Technology and Math, at California State University, 
San Barnardino.  Ken became a member of TAPPED IN in 1999 when he was introduced 
to it while participating in the Teach the Teachers Collaborative (TTTC).

<h2>Ken's Perspective</h2>

My name is Ken Decroo (KenD). I was introduced to TAPPED IN while participating 
in the Teach the Teachers Collaborative (TTTC) in 1999 and have been a member 
ever since.  I teach SEI science at Harry S. Truman Middle School and graduate 
level courses in the Department of Education, Science, Technology and Math, at 
California State University, San Barnardino.
<br><br>
I am a life long learner.  I hold two masters degrees, Anthropology from the 
University of California, Riverside and Instructional Technology, California 
State University, San Bernardino.  I am finishing up a third MA in Administration 
at CSUSB.  I am a bilingual teacher and work with students whose primary language 
is Spanish.  I love what I do.  There is nothing I would rather do than teach. 
I especially like the balance I get from teaching both middle school students 
and teachers. 
<br><br>
I have pursued both these areas within the landscape of curriculum and instruction.  
I believe we cannot address any issue in education, anymore, without assessing how 
it supports standards based curriculum.  I have attempted, in my practice, to reflect 
on how what I do furthers our curricular goals as a district.  On the site level, 
I have actively supported a model that analyzes school performance, based on State 
and District assessments, with the goal of isolating content clusters that can be 
targeted with specialized techniques in Bilingual Education and Technology.  The 
goal is support and improve student performance.
<br><br>
I have implemented this model at Truman, in my regular classes in my technology 
learning lab and in my technology/ELL consulting period, as a classroom teacher 
and as an Administrative Designee.
<br><br>
Since the onset of the Internet and its hybrid, the World Wide Web (WWW), educators 
have recognized its potential to engage students in constructive learning. When 
students go online, they enter a world of learning where they can find information 
about seemingly any subject. Interconnected around the world, there are literally 
millions of web pages representing the entire array of human endeavors. It is a 
vast resource of information that doubles every year. The shear volume of the 
Internet often makes the process of understanding, evaluating and using it seem 
overwhelming.  Not all sources in this vast and diverse media are equal in 
reliability and quality.
<br><br>
Millions of web sites are created in both academic and commercial environments 
every year.  In this expanding environment, it is the challenge for every educator 
to hone this vast resource to support existing curriculum.  Few studies have examined 
the effectiveness of using web sites in teaching. The design of web sites has 
developed, in the last ten years, from simple linear presentations to interactive 
multi/hypermedia sources of information.
<br><br>
We are faced with the challenge of teaching our students the strategy of making 
sense of it and finding their way around it.  But very often, it is just the 
opposite of this that plays out in the classroom.  Our students, having grown 
up digitally, are comfortable in this media and find themselves in the reversed 
role of teaching their teachers how to use the Internet. This is less than an 
ideal pedagogy.
<br><br>
Within this landscape it has been my charge to infuse technology into the 
district curriculum. It is my belief that the concept of technology infusion 
needs more attention in order to harness its power to meet the target of 
improving student learning.   Its essence is in using technology to support 
standards based curriculum.  But confusion has arisen, among educators, as to 
what that actually looks like and how it works.  A technology plan must be clear 
on what infusion is and how it works if it is to promote student achievement and 
learning.
<br><br>
Technology can only be successfully infused when curricular needs are defined. 
Several items need to be taken into account. 1) Identification of curricular needs 
must be data driven.  2) Each school has unique and site-specific needs dependent 
on a variety of factors.  3) In most cases, we already have the data to determine 
and address those needs.
<br><br>
The results of the standardized and district assessments give us an excellent 
starting point for determining the curricular target for a school site. We are 
able to evaluate student performance by content clusters that align to the strands 
of the California Standards.  By identifying sub-group movement and sub-standard 
performance, we can implement technological methods and applications that can 
facilitate better learning. By determining the needs of a particular site based 
on this data, we can design a unique program to infuse technology into the 
curriculum, a technology plan.  This allows a school site to better channel 
its technological resources to get more "bang for the buck."  
The plan must take into account the mission of the school, the curricular needs 
of the school, the actual and future technological assets of the school site, 
and the level of technological competence of the staff. Hence, methods and 
applications can be incorporated into a technology plan based on these needs 
taking into account the unique constituency of the school site.
<br><br>
I use TAPPED IN extensively in my University classes to develop an online 
professional community of learners.  It allows me to hold virtual office 
hours and online classes in my TAPPED IN office.  Further, my students are 
learning about technology by using it.  TAPPED IN is an integral part of my 
practice as a university lecturer.  My goal is to introduce and support my 
students in learning how to incorporate this powerful tool to help further 
their professional growth.
