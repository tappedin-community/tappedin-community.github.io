<h1>Tapped In Member Perspectives: Meet Kathleen Fletcher Bacer</h1>

Kathleen Fletcher Bacer (KathleenDB) is an associate professor and the creator and 
director of Azusa Pacific University's new  
<a href="http://www.apu.edu/education/advanced/edtechonline/">Online Master of Arts in 
Educational Technology</a> degree program which will make its debut February 2003 just in time to 
utilize the new TAPPED IN interface (currently known as TAPPED IN 2).  Coming from 
19 years of K-8 classroom teaching, and 9 years training teachers in classroom 
management and manipulative math techniques, Kathleen now trains teachers how to 
utilize technology in the classroom to impact the teaching/learning process. She 
has been with APU full time for 5 years where she directed the regional-based MA 
in Ed Tech program. She earned her masters in education with an emphasis in mathematics 
from Cal Poly, Pomona, CA and her doctorate in educational technology from Pepperdine 
University in 1999.

<h2>Kathleen's Perspective</h2>

It was through my doctoral work at Pepperdine that I first fell in love with MOOs. 
Linda Polin introduced me to ElMundo - Pepperdine's Moo at the time Ð and I was hooked. 
It was a wonderful way to creatively express myself online and ElMundo still holds a 
dear space in my virtual persona today. A year after I completed my doctorate I noticed
ElMundo was seeming a bit disserted.  Where had everyone gone? I was told by a colleague 
that they had moved to TAPPED IN, the latest and greatest. I soon discovered that it 
was indeed just that!
<br><br>
For me, the nurturing and sustaining of the internal and external teaching/learning 
environment, whether it be face-to-face or online is extremely important.  I remember 
my first times in TAPPED IN in 1998 with the patience of BJB and Judi as I built my 
office and classrooms. Creating that special place online that invites the learning 
process was so easy and fun with what TAPPED IN had to offer. I loved the objects 
and the creative spaces I could create. My master's students loved it also. It was 
a great way to immerse them in what I refer to as a dynamic online learning community.
<br><br>
Just a few of my favorites in TAPPED IN:
<br>
<ul>
  <li>The wonderful people at the help desk - always willing to help my students. Thanks! 
    I still look forward to hugging BJB and Judi in person someday!</li>
  <li>Being able to get transcripts of archived sessions.  Many times my schedule does 
    not allow me to attend in real time. I often pop in, grab a transcript, print it and 
    it's a great way for me to stay connected and current in my field.</li>
  <li>The fact that TAPPED IN is a private community - by that I mean, it is a safe, 
    secure community where I can always trust appropriate behavior, language and respect 
    to reside. It is so much more than a "chat room" with a real wonderful community of 
    learners. </li>
  <li>The environment you can create with the objects, your office, and displaying 
    emotions. I can be myself online.</li>
  <li>"Seeing" the dynamic learning that emerges every time I am in with my students 
    teaching and knowing too, that they are now connected to a much larger global 
    community rich with resources, experts, and a love of learning.</li>
</ul>

What's next? I am excited about TAPPED IN 2 and the potential it holds. I have had 
the wonderful opportunity of working with Judi in getting our APU building ready for 
my new online program. It is definitely a different look and feel. Sort of like 
moving from OS9 to OSX :-). The learning curve will be much easier for newbies. You 
will miss some things at first but in time I think TAPPED IN 2 will have all the 
comforts of our old home and so much more. You will be amazed at the speed and ability 
to multi-task and work within many different information spaces while sharing the 
same virtual space. I am excited to bring a whole new group of students into 
TAPPED IN 2 and create a dynamic online learning environment.  I couldn't imagine 
delivering a completely online program without it!
