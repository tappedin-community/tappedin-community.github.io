<h1>Tapped In Member Perspectives: Meet Shunichiro Ito</h1>

Shunichiro Ito (ShunI) teaches business communications and Internet English at 
Bunkyo Women's College, Tokyo, Japan. His current interest is further refining 
his syllabus for his EFL course based on web exploration projects and computer 
mediated communication activities. In the long term, he wants to show to EFL 
teachers in Japan how Internet and CMC resources may be used to provide excellent 
learning facilities otherwise unavailable in classroom environment.

<h2>Shun's Perspective</h2>

Sometime ago I wrote an email in response to a request from a certain foundation. 
The foundation was asking what I actually do using technology in my EFL classes of 
Japanese college girls.  In return for my cooperation, the director sent me a video 
titled, &quot;Learn and Live,&quot; promoting use of technology in education. I 
learned then what the George Lucas Educational Foundation was doing for teachers. 
Kids in the video all had their eyes gleaming with interest.
<br><br>
For awhile I had been trying to find teachers or groups of students to meet with 
our students at TAPPED IN for discussion. Our class hours were so different that 
I had found none. Then BJ Berquist’s suggestion to meet with the WebHeads discussion 
group led to a breakthrough.  For the first time in their life, the girls were 
interactively communicating online with Vance Stevens in Abu Dhabi, UAR, and Dan 
Bilitz in Wisconsin. The following week our students met with Rachael and her 
students from Taiwan. They were all excited and happy to find that their English 
was good enough to exchange comprehensible messages. Some had frustrations, of course, 
but they told me later they wanted to have more opportunities like those. The teachers 
needed to type slowly, at my request, so as not to overwhelm the novices in fast paced 
text-only communication. Later tally shows that in the 45-minute session one of the 
girls made as many as 30 utterances. While standing by in case girls needed my help, 
I noted they had that same gleam in their eyes as I saw in that video. 
<br><br>
I know some American ESL teachers feel that face-to-face is the best environment for 
language acquisition and imply MOO sessions have less value for interactive 
communication. But there are millions of English learners elsewhere in the world 
for whom the only chance they have of being immersed in English language environment 
is when they are in the class rooms with native speaker teachers. TAPPED IN makes 
it possible for non-native speaker teachers to take their students out of the old 
classrooms to interact in English and to improve their communication skills while 
meeting interesting people around the world. Two years of wandering in the Internet 
universe made me realize that there is no other warm and comfortable meeting 
environment than TAPPED IN for teachers and students for activities of this kind.
