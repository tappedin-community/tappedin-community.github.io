<h1>Tapped In Member Perspectives: Meet Gail Hoskins</h1>

<p>Gail Hoskins is Senior Outreach Coordinator at the Eisenhower National
 Clearinghouse (ENC) in Columbus OH.  A K-12 math and science teacher
 center, ENC is funded by the U.S. Department of Education and produces free
 print and CD-ROM professional development resources.
 <a href="http://www.enc.org">ENC Online</a> offers almost 24,000 catalog records
 of K-12 math and science curriculum resources and it logs 1.8 million page
 views per month. ENC has 125,000 subscribers to its (free) print ENC Focus.</p>

<p>Gail is responsible for presentations and exhibits for the conference
 presence of ENC.  Besides presenting and exhibiting at events like the
 national meetings of the National Council of Teachers of Mathematics (NCTM)
 and the National Science Teacher Association (NSTA), Gail provides training
 and support for "friends of ENC" around the nation. She has presented to
 groups ranging in size from two to 1400 and in duration from five minutes
 to four days.</p>

<p>Before joining ENC when it began in fall 1992, Gail was a high school math
 teacher and a K-12 mathematics coordinator.  She has taught in rural, urban,
 and suburban districts and has lived in six states and traveled to untold
 convention centers around the country. Her interaction with teachers has
 enabled her to continue to be a voice for the teacher perspective at the
 Eisenhower National Clearinghouse.</p>

<h2>Gail's Perspective</h2>

<p>I became a member of Tapped In on July 22, 1997. (I still have that email--mentioning
 Mark and Patti--and notice that Tapped In did not yet have its own domain then!).
 I did my first online presentation for Tapped In on February 23, 1999, and, as is
 my custom at each event I do, provided a web page summary. That is still online
 at <a href="http://www.enc.org/training/tappedin.htm">http://www.enc.org/training/tappedin.htm</a>
 (Caution: just like Tapped In has changed and improved and reinvented itself
 several times, so has ENC. The links from that page to ENC go to the ENC Online
 of three iterations ago!)</p>

<p>While some members become quite involved in all aspects of TAPPED IN, my use
 of it has been as a tool for conducting online presentations or training. I have
 done various After School Online events and participated in several of the summer
 carnivals and festivals.  (Do you remember the Crazy Eights Carnival on 8/8 in
 2001? Who else but me would take Tapped In folks so literally and write my blurb for
http://www.tappedin.org/info/sc/sc01.html#enc
 as...</p>

<i>8 Ways to Use ENC with Math and Science</i><br>
 Gr8t resources for K-12 teachers are accessible by visiting the Eisenhower National Clearinghouse (ENC), (www.enc.org), the g8way to inform8ion about the ENC Collection of Curriculum Resources. Learn about the Digital Dozen with its six-year archive, ENC Focus, Classroom Calendar, and professional development resources. First-time visitors or experienced users of ENC Online, you'll r8 this d8 one where you'll be glad you weren't l8! Come communic8 with Gail Hoskins.<br>

<p>I have found Tapped In to be a great resource for a number of reasons:</p>

<li>The Help Desk folks (BJ and others) are always there and always helpful and
 always do all they can to make any event a success. Yes, they have the skill and
 experience to make my online event be successful; they also make me feel good
 about it too!</li><br>

<li>Tapped In is a professional community for educators.  I can count on behavior
 and interests that make me comfortable inviting others to join me there. I
 particularly appreciate the way members seem to practice the "presumption of
 positive intent." Novice and experienced members alike are careful to project
 competence on the actions of others.  Comments that _might_ be perceived negatively
 are usually followed with an "opps, I mean...." Tapped In is a place where we all
 learn by doing and everyone works to help everyone look good.</li><br>

<li>Tapped In is always changing.  (Change is sometimes hard, I know....) But
 Tapped In has improved over the past six years and become easier to use and
 offered more and more features.</li><br>

<li>Tapped In lets me be me. There are features (wonderful features--I have
 dabbled with them) that I haven't really mastered and incorporated into my own
 style.  And that is OK with the folks there.  They let me use (and help me to
 use well) the tools that I need for what I want to do, but they don't try to make
 every (or for that matter, any) event that I do be a teaching session "about"
 Tapped In.</li><br>

<p>There are four other reasons why I have been so pleased with my experiences
 using Tapped In over the years.  Those reasons are practice, practice, practice,
 and (finally) practice. I value the time that participants in an event that I
 lead are giving me, and I respect that by doing the best possible professional
 development that I can.  Just like I have a check list of things to do before I
 travel with staff across the country to a "real" conference to do a training
 session or exhibit, I prepare both the content that I wish to share and the
 methods that I plan to use and the safety back-up plan that I'll turn to if
 "what if" really happens.</p>

<p>I am pleased to be a part of the Tapped In community and excited about all
 the new improvements that TI2 offers. And I plan to be a member when Tapped
 In 3 is launched! (Hear those hard working Help Desk folks groan??)</p>
