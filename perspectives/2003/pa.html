<h1>Tapped In Member Perspectives: Meet Paul Allison</h1>

Paul is a high school writing teacher who has evolved over the past several years 
into a technology teacher, although his students say that he's a "wanna be humanities 
teacher."  He has worked in alternative schools in New York City for over 15 years. 
He taught interdisciplinary classes with a focus on writing and the humanities at 
University Heights High School (UHHS) which was a small (450 students) secondary 
school in the one of the poorest sections of the Bronx for a dozen years.  Then 
he taught students who were recent immigrants at The International High School (IHS) 
in Queens. After three years of working with these English Language Learners, he 
returned to a small, high school in a poor neighborhood, this time on the East Side 
of Manhattan, at the East Side Community High School (ESCHS). 

<h2>Paul's Perspective</h2>

I began experimenting with TAPPED IN about a year ago, trying different types of 
forums with some of my students at IHS. To get some idea of what this looked like, 
take a look at this transcript: 
<a href="http://www.lehman.cuny.edu/litstudies/techprojects/myclasssite2001/webroot/sum2002/annaexcerpt.html">Chatting in a Virtual World</a>
<br><br>
In addition to teaching secondary school students, I'm also the Technology Liaison 
for the New York City Writing Project. This summer I introduced TAPPED IN to the 
15 teachers who were participating in a 3-week "Technology and Language" workshop 
that I co-facilitated at the 
<a href="http://www.lehman.cuny.edu/litstudies/techprojects/myclasssite2001/webroot/sum2002">New York City Writing Project, Lehman College, CUNY</a>.  
And I've expanded my TAPPED IN adventures with the students at ESCHS this year</a>. 
<br><br>
My work in technology began at UHHS seven or eight years ago when I began building
multi-media projects with students (see 
<a href="http://www.essentialschools.org/pubs/exhib_schdes/dp/uhhsport/home.html">David R.'s Portfolio</a>) 
with the help of David Niguidula and 
<a href="http://www.essentialschools.org/pubs/exhib_schdes/dp/dpframe.htm">The Digital Portfolio Project</a>. 
This project to develop a prototype of a digital portfolio was a significant one 
for me, and its shadow can still be seen in the Web sites I build for my classes. 
Niguidula introduced me to hypermedia several years ago and now with the links 
between student work and the assignments that led to that work on this site, 
I think that I'm making my way back to the vision of digital portfolios that 
started me on this hypermedia journey in the first place. To see much of this 
work go to <a href="http://MyClassSite.org">MyClassSite.org</a>.
<br><br>
Portfolio assessment animated my work with colleagues, students, parents and 
critical friends for many years at University Heights Secondary School. 
[See an account of this work that I wrote for Assessing Student Learning, edited 
by David Allen.] As support for this work began to dry up, I moved on to the 
International High School at LaGuardia Community College in Queens New York. 
<br><br>
After two years, I'm finding that the drought can't be escaped by going to a 
school where support for alternative assessment is clear and loud. Choked by 
state imposed tests, we are struggling to maintain our focus on projects and 
portfolios. It's not easy.
<br><br>
Even while paying "tribute to... our teachers and counselors" for helping 
"most of our candidates for graduation" to "pass all requirements," the 
principal of IHS, Eric Nadelstern, wrote (in the Spring 2001) the following 
lament to our staff: "The need to prepare students for high stakes Regents 
examinations has taken its toll. As I walk around the school, students' 
voices have been replaced by teachers' voices; at times students appear 
bored and disengaged in ways that I have not seen in years; and, in many 
of our classrooms, there is scant evidence of student product." I think 
the possibilities represented in the Web sites that I have helped students 
to create over the past few years provide many answers to the "scant evidence 
of student product" problem.
<br><br>
I'm pointing to the anti-portfolio, high-stakes testing environment in which 
we all work because I'm beginning to see how we might be able to use multi-media 
projects displayed on a Web-site to continue building a culture for alternative 
assessment that keeps student work central even in these difficult days. 
<br><br>
At the very least, I can say that this hope of using the Web as a place of 
resistance to testing has been one of my biggest personal motivations for 
working with technology. The World Wide Web is a place where students and 
teachers can collect both curriculum and student work, including sound, 
images (still and moving), links, and texts.
<br><br>
Creating high school classes with a variety of connections to cyberspace 
(Web, bulletin boards, MOO's) hasn't been easy, but the benefits far outweigh 
the costs involved. I find that I'm constantly in need to learn new software 
(often only a step in front of my students). I have to keep organized a dizzying 
array of folders, and documents, and on a weekly, sometimes daily basis I have 
to correct, upgrade, modify, and re-invent this the pages on this site. So, 
why do I do it?
<br><br>
My original motivation had three parts. I wanted to create a space on the Web 
where students could publish their work. I also wanted to model for students 
this new "hybrid literacy of visual and verbal authorship on the Web." 
(Craig Stroupe, College English, Volume 62, Number 5, May 2000, p. 607.) 
Third, in the back of my mind I thought that it would be useful for students 
to be able to reference (make links to) the assignments that related to the 
work that they would be posting.
<br><br>
Although these motivations remain important reasons for doing this work, other 
thoughts about why a teacher might engage in Internet-based teaching have evolved 
as my work has grown from the Web to bulletin boards (such as Nicenet), then to 
chatting in TAPPED IN. First, I'm not sure that we have much of a choice.... 
Computer-mediated communication, which includes everything from chatting in 
TAPPED IN to posting a well-crafted Web site, has become one of the basic 
literacies. If we aren't helping our students work with this media, then we 
aren't teaching them to be literate. I agree with Jeff Wilhelm, who paraphrases 
J. David Bolter to make this same point in an article in Voices from the Middle 
(Volume 7, Number 3, March 2000, p. 4). Wilhelm says that this "renowned classics 
scholar and ... author of Writing Space (1991), argues that if our students are 
not reading and composing with various electronic technologies, then they are 
illiterate. They are not just unprepared for the future, they are illiterate 
right now, in our current time and context." We can't allow our students to be 
on the wrong side of the digital divide. For me the sites my students create 
are more than an interesting collection of work; they are points on the road 
that I believe all teachers need to begin to walk. Computer-mediated communication 
is a basic literacy. 
<br><br>
A second new motivation for doing this work and one that feels like less of 
a burden that the one I sketched out above has to do with control of the 
materials we use on our classrooms. I have come to understand that Web design 
can be a very powerful source for teachers who want to develop their own rich 
resources for their students. My work this year helped me understand the vision 
that Andrea A. diSessa lays out in his book Changing Minds: Computers, Learning, 
and Literacy (2000 Massachusetts Institute of Technology.) These paragraphs from 
pages 41-43 summarize his vision and, for me, state clearly what motivates my work 
with the Internet. 
<br><br>
"I believe computational media and associated new literacies may be exactly the 
infrastructural change that can support converting schools... into vital communities 
of tool building and sharing. The new genre of software I have in mind is a set of 
open, reconfigurable, repurposeable tools for student tasks, tasks that are more 
like design and student research than conventional activities such as exercises 
and short problem solving. Such a shift in student activity is consistent with 
much that is recommended in many current educational reform documents. Nevertheless, 
I believe those reform efforts could be immensely aided with suitable material 
support, a point that is almost never taken to heart. Reform needs implements, not 
just implementation plans. ...I believe we can revitalize teachers' professional 
experience by fostering their central participation in the production of such tools 
as well as their roles as a coach and mentor to students. We would be making a 
fairly radical departure from current assumptions and practice in which teachers 
are barely trusted to copy worksheets, let alone create (or even modify!) substantial 
new materials." 
<br><br>
All of this may sound lofty, but it gets my juices stirred up, and more importantly, 
it reminds me why I spend so much time maintaining and re-creating my class Web sites. 
Yes, you will find syllabi in these Web sites, and you'll find a curriculum archive. 
You will also find a rich trove of student work in many different disciplines and media. 
But what keeps me going is the potential to use the Internet to remake school by putting 
me at the center of creating "open, reconfigurable, repurposeable tools for student 
tasks." When I'm in that central, creative place with my teaching, I can help students 
find that place as well. And that is ultimately why I think teaching with Internet 
tools like TAPPED IN is important.
