<h1>Tapped In Member Perspectives: Meet Angela Redden</h1>

Angela writes in her Tapped In description, "I hate writing these description things. I never know what to say about myself. I am a mom, a wife, and a teacher. I love my kids, my husband, and my profession. I am also a co-director of the West Tennessee Writing Project and I think every teacher should know about the National Writing Project. I teach 8th grade literature and I love my 8th graders."<br> 
 
<h2>Angela's Perspective</h2>

I first wandered in to Tapped In on December 31, 2003.  It was the eve of a new year, and I wandered into a new world.  When I wandered on to the Tapped In Campus and found myself in the reception room, there were friendly people waiting to greet me.  At that time, I didn't really know how I would use Tapped In, but I knew it would become part of my life.  I had been fascinated with the idea of meeting people from around the globe, but had become exhausted with the conversations I had found in other chat rooms.  They seemed to always turn into sleazy pick up lines.  I had begun to wonder if there were any other decent human beings who could hold an online conversation.  I knew instantly that I had found my home on the net when I wandered in to Tapped In that cold December day.  <br>
<br>
Over two years later, Tapped In is still part of my life.  I have found that many of my colleagues do not share my curiosity for meeting people from across the globe, but they do like to be able to stay connected to their friends from across the state.  This past summer I started a group room and introduced Tapped In to members of the 2005 West Tennessee Writing Project Summer Institute.  Through Tapped In we have been able to stay connected and have discussions throughout the school year that would have been impossible because we live all across Middle and West Tennessee.  In our group room, we are able to share resources, ideas, support, and laughter.  We meet on Monday nights to chat, and we share ideas on the discussion boards throughout the week.  Being able to stay connected with like minded colleagues is extremely important to me, and Tapped In is the perfect tool for connecting.<br>
<br>
I also started a group room for my students this year.  I think their comments sum up the experience best:<br>
<br>
"Well, if you think about it some people are talking to people on TappedIn that they wouldn't talk to in the hallway or in the classroom.It is helping our communication skills.<br>
<br>
"I think tapped in is helping everyone understand what everyone else is thinking.so,yes I think tapped in is helping."<br>
<br>
"I do think that tapped in is helping me in school. Since Mrs. Redden started it, I have been making better grades and I understand the stuff we are talking about better."<br>
<br>
Tapped In has made it possible for my students and I to continue conversations outside the limits of a 45-minute class period, and initiate conversations that we wouldn't have initiated in the classroom. <br>
<br>
I am very thankful that I wandered into the world of Tapped In and that it has become a part of my life.<br>
