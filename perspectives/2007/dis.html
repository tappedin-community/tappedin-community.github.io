<h2>Diallo's Perspective</h2>

I am professor of Instructional Technology at Salisbury University. I teach courses that introduce pre-service teachers to using technology in the classroom. The students in the course use Tapped In to organize, collaborate, research, contribute, and share ideas.<br> 
<br>
First, Tapped In encourages dialogue among students and provides a platform where all members make contributions to classroom discussions. Students use Tapped In to lead discussions of various readings during the semester based on some aspect of the reading as determined by the discussion leader. Other students respond and cite references to provide the class with a wealth of information. This allows students time be reflective and focused as the readings are discussed. It is also a way to get input from all learners. Traditional discussion has two limitations which are time and the ability of students to be silent during conversations. Using Tapped In for discussion erases the limitation of time and the ability of students to be silent.<br>  
<br>
Second, Tapped In can be used for students to do self-reflections as well as peer-to-peer evaluations. For example, as students learn to create digital stories, students are expected to read the script of a classmate and provide feedback. Additionally, students view the final video of the students and provide feedback for the movie. This space is also used for students to reflect on various assignments throughout the semester. Students evaluate their own work and discuss progress made towards a particular assignment.<br> 
<br>
Third, pre-service students search for and become members of existing groups. This encourages professional development and provides a wealth of ideas from various educators. Pre-service teachers are exposed to the idea that learning is not limited to the walls of academia or the voice of a single professor. This collaborative nature allows students to experience a rich, diverse exposure to professionals.<br> 
<br>
Finally, students use Tapped In to evaluate and discuss other educational technology. For examples, students participate in webquests and simulations as assigned. Then they report on the strengths and improvements determined based on experience with the technology. Evaluations range from design to communication of content.<br> 
<br>
Tapped In provides a way to create a class that continually grows from one semester to the next. The information archived from a previous class is easily accessible for new students. This effectively creates a knowledge base that expands as new students learn from previous students. Learners experience a dynamic, collaborative environment built in a comprehensive platform.
