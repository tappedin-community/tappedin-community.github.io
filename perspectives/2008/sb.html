<h1>Tapped In Member Perspectives: Meet Sharon Bowers</h1>

Sharon is a teacher in Virginia Beach City Public Schools, working as an Educator-in-Residence for the National Institute of Aerospace (NIA) in Hampton, Virginia.  As an EIR, she develops resources to help teachers use instructional technology to integrate Science, Technology, Engineering, and Mathematics (STEM) into their curriculum. Tapped In is one tool Sharon uses to support professional development training for teachers across the country.<br> 
 
<h2>Sharon's Perspective</h2>

As an Educator-in-Residence, I have the unique opportunity to maintain active ties to teachers in the classroom AND work with scientists, engineers, and researchers at the National Institute of Aerospace (NIA) and NASA centers nationwide.  In this dual placement, I bring cutting edge Science, Technology, Engineering, and Mathematics (STEM) content to teachers through NIA and NASA real-world examples and applications.<br>   
<br> 
Not only is it important for teachers to stay current with 21st Century content, but they also need help incorporating 21st Century technology into their instruction.  My work with Tapped In helps me share STEM resources and strategies with teachers through a personal, virtual connection.<br> 
<br> 
Over the last few years I have developed two "rooms" for Tapped In as repositories for NASA and NIA resources.  I've facilitated several "open houses" for these "rooms," encouraging teachers to use NIA and NASA experiences as real-world connections with standards-based curriculum.  <br> 
<br> 
It is exciting to use technology to help teachers and students look beyond classroom walls.  I've introduced Tapped In to teachers in my own school district and teachers around the country.  It is a wonderful resource to keep teachers connected, building upon face-to-face instruction to develop long-lasting learning communities.<br> 
<br> 
Tapped In rooms help busy teachers sort through reams of online educational resources.  We all know that time is precious.  Tapped In can be trusted to showcase only the very best in instructional educational resources for teachers. <br>  
<br> 
It's also important to note that the Tapped In "Help" desk is ALWAYS there when needed.  I never feel as if I have to navigate through Tapped In completely on my own. Every time I've needed answers and support, someone is "in" to help.  This level of personal support is important to all Tapped In participants.<br> 
<br> 
The face of education is ever changing.  Tapped In truly helps educators "tap in" to best practices in the use of educational technology.<br>
