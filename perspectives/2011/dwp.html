<h1>Tapped In Member Perspectives: Meet Reva Potter, Teresa Berndt, Lindsay Sorenson, and Anne Moege</h1>

<p>We are all teacher-leaders with Dakota Writing Project (DWP), Vermillion, SD.  DWP is a 
  chapter of the National Writing Project.  Reva (Belle Fourche, SD) and Anne (Mitchell, SD) 
  teach middle school language arts, Teresa (Mitchell, SD) teaches high school English, and 
  Lindsay (Austin, MN) teaches middle school science. In addition to our teaching duties, 
  we have recently been involved with co-facilitating a digital writing marathon, a 6-credit 
  online writing and technology course sponsored by Dakota Writing Project through the 
  University of South Dakota, Vermillion. </p>
 
<h2>Our Perspective</h2>

<p>Reva, Lindsay, and Anne were all participants of digital writing marathons sponsored by 
  Dakota Writing Project approximately 5 years ago.  These marathons were held specifically 
  for teacher-leaders involved in Dakota Writing Project and involved exploration of several 
  online writing spaces throughout two marathon "legs" -- one held in throughout the month of 
  July and another held in throughout the month of January.  Each week participants explored 
  the "technology space of the week," completing various writing activities.  In addition to 
  being one of the spaces we explored as a teaching tool, Tapped In became the "hub" for the 
  marathon activities.  Within the marathon "room," marathon participants chatted weekly about 
  their discoveries and also added thoughts to asynchronous discussions.</p>

<p>Last spring Dakota Writing Project director Michelle Rogge Gannon decided to bring the 
  digital writing marathon experience to teachers outside of DWP.  Under Michelle’s leadership, 
  two marathon groups formed -- one facilitated by Lindsay and Anne (July 2010 and January 2011) 
  and one facilitated by Reva and Teresa (September 2010 and January 2011).  The marathons 
  involved exploration of online spaces such as VoiceThread, Diigo, Googledocs, Glogster, 
  and Prezi; however, both groups once again utilized Tapped In as the main center for weekly 
  chats and discussion threads. Teacher participants (from South Dakota and Iowa) could also 
  find everything they needed to complete their coursework successfully within the rooms 
  set up for each group (the course syllabus, tutorials for the various tools, transcripts 
  of chats) and could share some of what they created throughout the course (lesson plans 
  utilizing one of the tools they explored, links to Glogster posters, and links to Prezi 
  presentations). All coursework was completed online, offering participants flexibility 
  and convenience in tackling their tasks.</p>
  
<p>We also called on Jeff Cooper, TI volunteer, to help us set up our space and to guide 
  our marathon participants’ through some of TI’s other resources.  BJ Berquist also offered 
  guidance in managing our spaces.</p>
  
<p>The marathons have been so successful that we plan to offer another marathon starting 
  this summer.  Tapped In has allowed us to provide quality professional development 
  teachers entirely in an online format, and we look forward to continuing to use it 
  for future digital writing marathons.</p>
