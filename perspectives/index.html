<p>"What a run, fantastic job so well done, many thanks, John." 
  -- John, Feb 2, 2013</p>

<p>"Just a brief note to say thank you so very much for everything, and I'm so sorry to 
  hear that Tapped In is being shut down.  I'd like to especially thank everybody from 
  the help desk. Thank you all very, very much."  
  -- Susan, from Iran, Feb 3, 2013</p>
  
<p>"To all of you -- Jeff, BJB, Dave, and all -- my heart is broken! I wish I were rich 
  enough to support TappedIn by myself. You have all done a spectacular job and I will miss you... 
  I'll have to look elsewhere for what you have provided so beautifully over the years. 
  Thank you, and I wish you all the best in wherever your journey takes you." 
  --  Wendy, March 1, 2013</p>
  
<p>"I have been using TappedIn and/or recommending the service for more almost 6 years. 
  It is a great resource and I am sorry to see it dissolve. Thank you for providing the service."
   -- Dialo, Feb 2, 2013</p>
  
<p>"I am a bit sad to hear that TI will be shutting down, although I completely understand. 
 I became a regular member of TI in 1999 as a master's student in the Pepperdine OMET program. 
 We LOVED TI!  We held many small group meetings in the hot tub or the treehouse ;).  
 And although we were physically dispersed all around the country, we really felt like 
 we were in each other's company and as connected as we could be. Times have progressed, 
 but I will always remember TI fondly and with great respect for what it meant to us 
 in the early days of building online learning communities."
  -- Dana, Feb 4, 2013</p>

  wonderful, educational inspiration that I have followed almost from the time you opened 
  your doors. Kudos to a great staff who was always so generous in cheerfully contributing 
  their time and effort to solving problems and educating members. You all will be greatly missed!"

   from it and have been glad of the existence of TappedIn." 
    -- Donna, Feb 4, 2013</p>
   
<p>"My name is Maria, I am Italian and I am writing from Italy. I just wanted to say 
  thank you for coming up with such a good idea, providing a wonderful service, and 
  sharing such precious resources. You have helped me out while I was teacher training 
  and student teaching, and of course you also help now that I work as a teacher. 
  Tapped in was a goldmine for finding resources and storing links and materials, 
  and it's a real shame it will have to shut down.I would also like to thank all 
  the people I chatted to in the Reception room, who were always ready to provide 
  explanations about tapped in, and to share tips and tricks. Good luck with your 
  new community experiences!"
