Research and theory suggest that both teachers and students benefit from sustained interpersonal relationships and interactions. For example, in a study at a major university, Pascarella and Terenzini (1980) found that informal interactions with faculty outside of class and regular interactions with other students correlated positively with students' persistence in their studies. Interaction with peers was a particularly significant factor in the persistence of female students. Similarly, contemporary approaches to teacher professional development posit that such efforts must engage teachers in a sustained way over time and must create membership in a broader community of professional practice (Little, 1993). Typical summer institutes for teachers do little to alter the isolated and isolating character of classroom teaching. 
<p>
In an effort to address these issues, we are conducting an interdisciplinary program of social science and computer science research on computer-supported collaborative learning within these two learning communities. In particular, we will focus on two communities that have been the focus of our previous research (e.g., Kozma, Russell, Jones, Marx, & Davis, 1996; Schlager & Schank, 1996): undergraduate chemistry students (in collaboration with the UCLA Molecular Science Project) and science teachers involved in professional development (in collaboration with the <a href="http://www.gene.com:80/ae/">Access Excellence 
</a>project at Genentech, Inc., and the 
<a href="http://www.beloit.edu/~bquest/">BioQUEST Curriculum Consortium.</a>) We plan to use the results of this research--and the participation of the two communities--to design and develop a network-based learning environment that supports a range of asynchronous and synchronous collaborative interaction among distributed teams on heterogeneous platforms.
<p>
Our objective is to facilitate highly interpersonal learning at a distance--we want to build the kind of computer-based social and task environment that can foster and sustain a range of enduring, highly interactive personal relationships and activities that motivate and support continuous learning. This goal will be achieved by developing specifications for specialized virtual places, resources, and capabilities that support the social roles and cognitive strategies involved in science learning.
<p>
Science simulations play a special role in augmenting distant collaborative learning. Students and teachers can point to their accompanying representations (such as diagrams, graphs, equations, and animations) and their specific features and talk about them to clarify what they mean, describe how they represent situations in the real world, and discuss how they are connected to and from each other. Teachers can work together to develop simulated problems for their students to solve, share techniques, and sustain and enrich their professional discourse through interaction with peers and computer models. As a result, both groups come to understand principles of science and engage in the process of science. Figure 1 is a simple illustration of the concept of merging the capabilities of an on-line environment with shared science simulations, such as Biota from the BioQUEST library.
<p>
The computer science and network engineering component of the project develops a networking architecture for implementing the resulting design specifications in a cross-platform computing environment. Two relatively disjoint advanced networking technologies will be coupled to form the core of the architecture. Client-server, multi-user virtual environment (MUVE) technology will be augmented by peer-to-peer, synchronous multimedia collaboration technology that provided simultaneous control and viewing of software applications. Accessibility and ease of use will be facilitated by exploiting the combined power and ubiquity of the World-Wide Web (WWW), Netscape, and Java for application development.
<p>
In the first phase of the project, we will conduct the prerequisite social science research and develop the hybrid architecture that couples the two target technologies. We will then populate the environment with customized resources and collaborative simulations for our two target learning communities by modifying existing educational materials and simulations, involving our communities in the design process. This phase will be funded by a two-year grant from the National Science Foundation Collaborative Research on Learning Technologies (CRLT) program beginning in 1997. With subsequent funding, we will deploy these resources and assess their use and impact on our target science learning communities, and collaborate with the Concord Consortium to scale up the use of this environment so as to support large, cross-national projects involving the distance learning of a large number of science teachers and students. Our expectation is that the project will result in research findings and technology development that will contribute to the emergence of highly interpersonal, distance learning communities for high school, college, and professional development.
<p>
High school biology teachers and (especially California-based) high school teacher groups who use BioQUEST and are interested in being part of our teacher community can 
contact us. Anyone interested in learning more multi-user virtual environments for supporting teacher professional development is invited to visit our on-line Teacher Professional Development Institute, <a href="http://tappedin.org">TAPPED IN</a>, and to become a member of our growing on-line community.

The window on the left shows a depiction of the "BioQUEST Room." Resources such as web pages, documents, and simulations can be opened by clicking on icons, such as the Biota icon. As shown in the conversation window at the bottom and the Biota windows on the right, anyone in the room may collaborate while jointly operating or viewing the simulation.
