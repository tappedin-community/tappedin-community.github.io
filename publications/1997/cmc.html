Several studies have looked at the strengths and weaknesses of synchronous (e.g., chat) and asynchronous (e.g., email and listservs) computer-mediated communication (CMC). For example, Sproull and Kiesler (1991) demonstrate how both synchronous and asynchronous CMC can increase equality in participation and change how people work, and Ackerman and Palen (1996) show how a simple synchronous chat-like help system has successfully supported a large university community for over seven years. Others have investigated the impact of asynchronous CMC on teacher communities in particular (Honey & Henriquez, 1993; Glazer, 1994; Levin, Waugh, Brown, & Clift; 1994; Bennett, Honey, Hupert, & Meade, draft), with mixed results. 

For example, Glazer (1994) found that a NCTM-L listserv afforded many opportunities for rich discourse about mathematics education and how to implement the National Council of Teachers of Mathematics (NCTM) Standards, but only a few of the subscribers were significant contributors, and many cancelled their subscriptions after only a few days. Still others (e.g., Palfreyman & Rodden, 1996) have noted that although the World Wide Web is shared by a huge community of users, it is a strikingly lonely place devoid of social interaction and communication, "the most critical process in an organization" (Sproull & Kiesler, p. x).  In this section we review some of the findings from these studies, and discuss how they support our claim that TAPPED IN, with its combination of synchronous and asynchronous CMC tools and familiar, persistent discourse-support objects, offers a powerful work environment for teacher to participate in substantive, sustained professional development activities.
<BR><BR>
Sproull and Kiesler (1991) report their findings of over eight years of research on how CMC is changing how people work in organizations, concluding that these technologies "...do not simply cross space and time; they also can cross hierarchical and departmental barriers, change standard operating procedures, and reshape organizational norms" (p. ix).  For example, they report that in face-to-face meetings, talking time is not well distributed across participants; half of the members talk only 10 or 20 percent of the time, and one or a few people dominate (managers over subordinates, men over women) even when the more vocal members do not have more expertise on the current topic. They find that such interactions dampen creativity and productivity in face-to-face meetings--members spend too much time listening instead of thinking, and try to please each other.
In contrast, high status people do not dominate in synchronous and asynchronous electronic discussions as much as they do face-to-face, and participation is significantly more equal (as much as twice the equality of participation), and more ideas are generated. In the absense of social cues, there are fewer social pressures to conform and participants focus more on the words than on each other. In electronic discussions (both synchronous and asynchronous), multiple people can advocate an idea "first" (virtually simultaneously) without first "listening" to others, whereas in face-to-face discussions only one person can talk first (usually a high-status member). 
<BR><BR>
In face-to-face discussion, positions taken by speakers tend to confirm those taken by previous speakers, so that the group converges on concensus quickly (e.g., the third speaker's position often equals the final group choice). 
In contrast, electronic discussions tend to not reach concensus as quickly, and unlike the dynamics of face-to-face discussions which are generally predictable, electronic discussions are less predictable. They often display deeper conflict (partly because members are less influenced by social conventions, feel less empathy, etc.), but result in more democratic decisions. Although consensus and cohesiveness is pleasant, studies have also shown that conflict is beneficial. (Interestingly, members of groups with little contention tend to think they've done well when they haven't, and members of critical groups tend to report their group did poorly when they did very well.)  
<BR><BR>
Sproull and Kiesler also report that group decision making can seem to take much longer in synchronous electronic discussions (e.g., up to 4 times as long for a three-person group), but considering time saved in travel, writing memos, talking on the phone, etc., this doesn't necessarily increase the total time groups need to complete a project. Face-to-face groups also incur a coordination cost called "process loss", which is basically the time lost by the serial nature of such meetings (only one person can talk at a time, everyone else has to listen), time lost repeating information to late arrivals, and time lost disagreeing over what was settled earlier in the meeting (group memory is often faulty). 
They also found that people who use CMC a lot are just as committed to their team as people who talk a lot in face-to-face meetings; how satisfied a person is with their group is directly related to how much he or she contributes, and more people can enjoy the benefits of active participation in electronic discussions. They conclude that there is real value in electronic discussion, and that it can even be more valuable than face-to-face discussion in many (but not all) circumstances. Others suggest that CMC is particularly valuable when participants combine periodic face-to-face meetings with ongoing electronic discussion (e.g., Hagel & Armstrong, 1997; Schlager & Schank, 1997; Schlager, Fusco & Schank, 1998).

Many education researchers promote on-line communties and electronic discussion as forums for supporting teacher professional development (e.g., Honey & Henriquez, 1993; Levin, Waugh, Brown, & Clift; 1994; Bennett, Honey, Hupert, & Meade, draft). It seems clear that gaining access to a larger community of educators and colleagues which whom they can discuss pedagogy and content would help teachers reach higher levels of professional development. Indeed, Yamashita (1987) found a positive correlation between award-winning mathematics teachers and interaction with mathematics educators outside of their local community. Studies of asynchronous forums devoted to teacher professional development issues suggest that access to a listserv of educators may be a necessary but not sufficient condition for increasing teachers' levels of professional development. Success seems to depend on certain critical (and rare) factors, such as effective facilitation. 
<BR><BR>
For example, Bennett, Honey, Hupert, and Meade (draft) report their findings on teachers communicating via the Mathmatics Learning Forums bulletin-board, an eight-week forum intended to help teachers introduce new reform-based mathematics teaching practices in their classrooms. They found that an successful forum (one with substantive discussions) required several components, including:

(1) a "safe" environment (teachers must be able to say what they really think and feel), 
(2) flexible activities (so the teachers can implement them in ways that make sense for their classrooms), 
(3) an effective facilitator, particularly one with teaching experience and who incourages personal introductions early in the forum and establishes a base of knowledge and understanding among participants, 
(4) small group size (their forums were limited to 10 participants), 
(5) minimal technical hurdles, and a faciliator who can help deal with technical problems when they arise, and 
(6) creative scheduling and structure (e.g., specific times for activities, readings, discussions) so as to minimize feelings of being rushed or frustrated, since teachers often have limited windows of time in which they can be on-line.

Glazer (1994) analyzed over 1000 email messages sent to an National Council of Teachers of Mathematics listserv from March 20, 1994 to June 8, 1994. The listserv had over 500 members, 36% of which were inservice teachers, 34% college professors, 10% graduate students, 3% undergraduates, and 17% other. He reports the majority (78%) of the messages sent to the listserv during this period were sent by a small percentage (10%) of the members; 65% of the subscribers were just "lurkers", and close to 40% of the participant reported not being satisfied with their subscription. Glazer analyzed the topics of each message, and surveyed the members as to which topics they most often read or wanted to read about, and found significant mismatches between the desired and actual topics on the listserv. He concludes that mediation efforts are strongly needed to decrease the amount of unnecessary mail traffic and maintain the interest and involvement of a diverse group of mathematics educators, which is in concert with Bennett et al.'s finding that asynchronous teacher forums are successful only with a great deal of structure and intervention from a knowledgable and devoted facilitator.

One might expect the World Wide Web to be a great tool for supporting teacher professional development, given it's vast information resource pool. However, at present it is a strangely desolate place where little communication actually takes place. Web users are not aware of each other, and cannot easily discuss issues with others who are visiting the same web site, or annotate pages with comments for the benefit of themselves or others (e.g., leave a review). The current model of the web is in conflict with the vast amount of literature on the importance of awareness and interaction in studies of work (Bly, Harrison, & Irwin, 1993) and hence does not lend itself to supporting group work anywhere near as well as it could. Several research groups are developing protocols and research applications to support shared web browsing so that information can be discussed with others in real time, such as in a presentation or meeting (Palfeyman & Rodden, 1996; Roseman & Greenberg, 1996). 
<BR><BR>
What does all of this suggest about the effectiveness of an environment like TAPPED IN? Clearly CMC has great value and a vital role to play in the professional development of teachers, and shows a great deal of promise if supported and used in effective ways. CMC can increase the participation and equality in discussions regarding educational issues, and increase access to a larger community of knowledge and experiences. By providing access to selected, useful education-related listserves that teachers can read at their leisure from within TAPPED IN, members receive the benefits of participating in asynchronous discussion, in addition to the benefits of reflecting on the content of listserv messages with their TAPPED IN colleagues in real-time.  Meetings, when necessary, can be conducted in real-time and with the aid of familiar discourse support objects (like whiteboards, webviewers, and notes) not available in listservs or chats. Members can annotate and leave web pages for other members to review on their own, or lead real-time tours of web sites and discuss the information with others in the same room, thus using the web to really support group work right now. Further, many of the face-to-face meeting "process loss" factors are eliminated in TAPPED IN, where several people can offer ideas simultaneously (although this can lead to a problem following "threads"), one person can update a newcomer without disturbing the rest of the group (e.g., using the WHISPER command) or the newcomer can simply read the transcript of what has transpired, and disputes over prior group decisions are quickly settled by looking back at the transcript (the externalized "group memory" in this case). TAPPED IN policy also requires that each participating group take responsibility for facilitating activities with their members (which we've seen is crucial), and TAPPED IN staff is available on-line and via email to resolve technical difficulties if and when they arise. TAPPED IN offers great opportunities for cross-fertilization between teachers and members of our partner organizations, as well as with members of the listservs that TAPPED IN makes available to its members.
