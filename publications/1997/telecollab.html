Some approaches leverage the explosion of World Wide Web activity, while others take a more independent approach. For instance, collaboration can take the form of application-sharing or whiteboarding (sharing images or drawings), and involve synchronous and/or asynchronous communication through audio, video, and/or text. Collaborative artifacts such as drawings or notes may persist so that collaborators can later review material (as in many document-centric or place-based systems), or they may not (as in session-centric video teleconferencing systems). <p>Currently, there is no one system that meets everyone's (sometimes mutually exclusive) sets of requirements. We have identified ten properties particularly useful for comparing telecollaboration and groupware systems, based on our own experience, discussions, and criteria used in other comparisons of such  technology (Buxton, Bly, Frohlich, &amp; Whittaker, 1996; Hall, Vaisey, Shirmohammadi, &amp; Georganas, 1998; Long &amp; Becker, 1997). These properties are summarized in Table 1. (Note added March 2001: See an updated list of criteria for effective online community technology in our<a href="cscl99">1999 CSCL"From MOO to MEOW" paper</a>.) <p><CENTER><B>Table 1.</B> Useful properties for comparing telecollaborationsystems.<BR></CENTER><TABLE BORDER=1><TR><TD WIDTH=82><CENTER><B>Property</B></CENTER></TD><TD WIDTH=189><CENTER><B>Refers to</B></CENTER></TD><TD WIDTH=172><CENTER><B>Virtual Places</B></CENTER></TD></TR><TR><TD WIDTH=82>Accessibility</TD><TD WIDTH=189>Cross-platform ability, footprint, location transparency</TD><TD WIDTH=172>Via standard web browser, platform independent</TD></TR><TR><TD WIDTH=82>Artifact longetivity</TD><TD WIDTH=189>Persistence/storage of objects between sessions</TD><TD WIDTH=172>Persistent</TD></TR><TR><TD WIDTH=82>Awareness mechanisms</TD><TD WIDTH=189>Information about other users, gesturing support</TD><TD WIDTH=172>Gesturing, audio, text notification of where users are and their actions</TD></TR><TR><TD WIDTH=82>Communication architecture</TD><TD WIDTH=189>Peer-to-peer or centralized, view-independent object models or just screen sharing, number of users</TD><TD WIDTH=172>Hybrid architecture, highly interactive view-independent application sharing, continuum of single- to multi-user activities</TD></TR><TR><TD WIDTH=82>Synchronicity</TD><TD WIDTH=189>Synchronous (e.g. audio), semi-synchronous (e.g. chat), asynch-ronous communication, editing</TD><TD WIDTH=172>All supported</TD></TR><TR><TD WIDTH=82>Floor control</TD><TD WIDTH=189>Broadcast or forum styles, mechanisms for managing</TD><TD WIDTH=172>All supported via SCOOT</TD></TR><TR><TD WIDTH=82>Interface/ metaphor</TD><TD WIDTH=189>Place-based or conferencing metaphors, transparency</TD><TD WIDTH=172>Place-based</TD></TR><TR><TD WIDTH=82>Media types</TD><TD WIDTH=189>Text, graphics, video, audio, animations, simulations</TD><TD WIDTH=172>All except video conferencing</TD></TR><TR><TD WIDTH=82>Membership model</TD><TD WIDTH=189>Open or restricted, classes of participants (student, leader, etc.)</TD><TD WIDTH=172>Open, usernames/passwords, classes of participants if requested</TD></TR><TR><TD WIDTH=82>Modifiability/ extensibility</TD><TD WIDTH=189>Ability of users to create new objects, modify the interface</TD><TD WIDTH=172>Users can create/modify objects and rooms, move things, etc.</TD></TR></TABLE><P>Many common architectural and philosophical approaches limit currenttelecollaboration systems. For example, the communication topology for collaborationdata may be limited to a centralized client-server relationship.This impacts both the introduced transmission delays and the scalabilityover a large number of collaborators. Performance is further reducedwhen collaboration servers are required to service multiple simultaneoussessions. Systems that exhibit these characteristics include Tango(Beca et. al, 1998) Collaboratory Builder's Environment (Lee et.al, 1996), Placeware's Auditorium  (http://www.placeware.com),and DataBeam's Learning Server (http://learning.databeam.com).In contrast, peer-to-peer synchronous collaboration systems supportthe simultaneous control and viewing of software applicationsand audio/video conferencing, and scale well with increased numbersof users.  They can provide the ability to share the process ofperforming a task (i.e., a continuous flow of events that providean &quot;over the shoulder&quot; viewpoint) and maintain a dialogabout that task (audio and gesturing). Peer-to-peer systems includeMicrosoft's NetMeeting and Netscape's Conference. The major disadvantagesof Conference are that only two people can take part in a conferenceand it has no document or application-sharing ability; NetMeetingalso only allows audio and video sharing with one other person,and is only available on one platform (Windows 95/NT). Some systemsalso focus on a particular style of collaboration to the exclusionof other collaboration needs.  For example, Placeware's Auditoriumis focused on audio-visual presentations at the exclusion of supportfor asynchronous collaboration and single-user interactions.<BR><P>Session-based systems (often peer-to-peer) such as NetMeeting,Conference, and MCRLab's JETS (Shirmohammadi &amp; Geroganas,1997) employ a meeting-based metaphor in which distributed teamsare supported in synchronous meetings, but there is little orno support for asynchronous work and tools are usually not persistent. Place-based systems (often client-server) employ a spatial orbuilding/room metaphor to organize and enable social relationshipsand interactions in a distributed environment, and are often seenas the next evolutionary step beyond the desktop and meeting metaphors.Their strengths include creating and maintaining social spaces,supporting heterogeneous computing environments, and maintainingdynamically created resources. Examples include Jupiter and AstroVR(Curtis &amp; Nichols) and its decendent, Supernova (Brundage.&amp; Van Buren, 1998), TeamRooms (Roseman &amp; Greenberg), Taligent'sPeople, Places and Things (Orfali et. al) and the Rooms system(Robertson et. al). Place-based systems have many benefits oversession based systems, although the examples listed above haveseveral limitations--they require special client-server setups,are not cross-platform, are limited in the number of simultaneouslyactive users they can support, and/or require high-bandwidth conferencingequipment.<BR><P>Collaborative capabilities should also be a seamless extensionof a collaborator's working environment. Thus, applications shouldwork in isolation as well as in collaboration, with minimal collaborationartifacts in their user interfaces.  These capabilities must beable to easily transition between these two states. Furthermore,the development and integration of applications into the collaborationinfrastructure should have minimal impact on the design and structureof the application. Most current systems fail to satisfy theserequirements. For systems that only provide infrastructure, &quot;event-distribution&quot;(i.e., GUI toolkit-based implementations) and &quot;message passing&quot;schemes (e.g., Tango) alone are insufficient to provide a robustmulti-collaborator system.  <BR><P>Our<a href="http://www.sri.com/policy/teched/projects/vrplprom.htm">Virtual Places (VP)</a> system(which extends our <a href="http://tappedin.org">TAPPED IN</a> project) avoids the pitfalls of current systems by seamlessly integratingclient-server (MUVE) and peer-to-peer (SCOOT) technologies toovercome many limitations of both (see Table 1, third column),and provides the access and consistency protocols necessary forany reliable collaboration infrastructure.<BR><BR>We conducted a more in-depth survey of selected well-known telecollaboration systems to better understand of how VP will compare with related systems developed by industry and academia.Although several systems were candidates for this comparison,we identified eight systems that seemed most relevant:<ol><li> Placeware's <I>Auditorium</I> <li> Upper Atmospheric Research Collaboratory's <I>Collaboratory Builder's Environment</I><li> MITRE's <I>Collaborative Virtual Workspace</I><li> Netscape's <I>Conference </I>and<I> Collabra Discussion Groups</I>  <li> Electric Communities' <I>Microcosm</I><li> Microsoft's <I>Net Meeting</I> <li> Centra Software's <I>Symposium</I><li> TeamWave's <I>Workplace<BR></ol></I><P>We first briefly describe each system (mostly copied and pastedfrom web sites) and provide a URL for further information. Thenwe describe in more depth the properties we used for comparing them. Finally,we provide a chart that shows how each system (including VP) addresseseach property.<BR><BR>For another good review of telecollaboration systems, see<a href="http://www.ensc.sfu.ca/people/Faculty/vaisey/research/telelearning/telecollaboration.html">A Survey of Web-Based Telecollaboration Tools</a> (Hall, Vaisey, Shirmohammadi,  &amp; Georganas, 1998). They "do not consider tools that simply provide audio/video conferencing: some kind of shared workspace or file transfer capability is a neccesity for good and productive interaction". This survey review several applications, including Netscape's Conference, CU-SeeMe, Habanaro, ICP, MBONE, MCRLab's JETS, NetMeeting, PowWow, Shaking Hands, Sound IDEAS, THe Virtual Meeting, Voxphone, and ICQ. They compare their systems based on five properties, which map to our properties as follows<ol><li> A/V conferencing (encompassed by our Communciations Architecture)<li> Sharing (encompassed by our Media Types and Synchronicity)<li> Platform (encompassed by our Accessibility)<li> Number of participants (encompassed by our Communciations Architecture)<li> Price (encompassed by our Accessibility)</OL>They highly recommend NetMeeting, claiming it is "set apart from most of the other applications" and free, the main disadvantage being that it's only available on WIndow 95/NT.Hall and Vaisay don't review several systems reviewed here, including: Placeware's Auditorium, Upper Atmospheric Research Collaboratory'sCollaboratory Builder's Environment, MITRE's Collaborative Virtual Workspace, Electric Communities' Microcosm, Centra Software's Symposium, or TeamWave's Workplace. Indeed, the only overlap between their review and ours is Netscape Conference and NetMeeting!<H2><CENTER><FONT SIZE=4>Systems<BR></FONT></CENTER></H2><H3>Placeware's Auditorium   (Patti)</H3>Auditorium is a voice- andtext-chat-enabled environment with a Java client. When you enterthe Audience, you are placed in a seat and a row. There are eightpeople in each row who you can voice and text chat with. You canchange to another row using the Change Row button. You can talkone-on-one with other audience members by holding your mouse overtheir name and clicking the One-on-One button. You can mute otherstoo. When you enter the Auditorium for the first time, you areassigned a color. During the presentation, you can change thiscolor to give feedback to the presenters, respond to instant strawpolls, and interact with other users. If the Audience is filledwhen you come into the site, you enter as Standing Room Only,and view slides, listen to the presentation, and ask questions,but you can't chat with other users.<BR><BR>The Stage is the area where presenters display HTML-based slideshows, talk to the audience, and reply to live questions. It featuresa chat window that can display &quot;canned&quot; text that canbe synchronized with the slide show. Audience members can askthe presenter questions using the Ask button. Only the presenterwill see the question, and can edit it before responding to itpublicly in the chat window.  A Review button located next tothe slide show brings up a separate window with all slides. Audiencemembers can click through them and read comments that have beenadded. Slides can be annotated on the fly with underlines or anytype of drawing. If there are more than one presenter, each personwill receive his own colored chalk. Presenters can show pollingslides to take on-the-fly polls. Audience members answer a pollby clicking the mouse over a reply, their data is added to thosealso responding, and a dynamic chart appears in the poll's place.<BR><BR>For more information visit:  <a href="http://www.placeware.com">www.placeware.com</a><H3>Upper Atmospheric Research Collaboratory's Collaboratory Builder'sEnvironment  (Chris)</H3>One of its objectives is to the successfuldemonstration of the functionality and reliability of Java-basedcollaboration tools for scientific research. Allows collaborationin multiple shared &quot;rooms&quot;. Rooms can contain URLs andDistView-based collaborative tools such as Chat and shared whiteboard.Users can create rooms dynamically, modify contents of rooms dynamically,and participate in multiple rooms simultaneously.  The systemis reliable and functional in Netscape 3.0 under Windows 95, WindowsNT, Sun OS, Solaris, and HPUX.<BR><BR>For more information visit:  <a href="http://www.si.umich.edu/UARC/">www.si.umich.edu/UARC/</a><H3>MITRE's Collaborative Virtual Workspace (CVW) (Patti)</H3>CVW is a LambdaMOO-based collaboration environment in which peopleinteract with documents and each other in a shared virtual space.CVW supports persistence of all objects, including users and whiteboards.One can see, learn about and control access on both. Users canconnect from anywhere, and work with others without knowing theirlocation. Tools currently integrated include audio and video conferencing,document sharing, chat, and whiteboards. Rooms are also the basisfor document sharing. Users can drop documents of different typesinto a room, allowing anyone else in that room to read the documentor its metadata. Document types include whiteboards, URLs, anddocuments edited through the user's local applications, managedthrough a document server within CVW. The document server providesa universally available filespace and enforces single-user editingthrough check out and check-in. It also tracks information aboutwho has edited a document and when, and allows each editor tosummarize changes upon check-in.<BR><BR><BR>On top of the MOO server substrate, a core database implementsrules for the virtual space. The core contains object classesfor documents, rooms, users, tools and other objects. The documentserver is developed in Java. The CVW client is a Java based clientthat runs on Unix and Windows in a frames-enabled browser. Aninitial, very limited version also runs on the Apple Newton. Integratedtools include freely available multicast backbone (MBONE) toolsfor audio (Visual Audio Tool, developed by Lawrence Berkeley Labs)and video (Network Video, developed by Ron Frederick at XeroxPARC). The CVW server manages NV and VAT sessions as the usermoves from room to room, but actual communication between users'machines is peer-to-peer.  Two MITRE-developed whiteboards areintegrated. &quot;Whiteboard Lite&quot; provides simple whiteboardcapabilities: persistent documents into which backdrops can beimported and which allow simple markings to be made, copied, movedand deleted. A more complex and capable object-based NITF-compliantwhiteboard is used for advanced image analysis applications.<BR><BR><BR>For more information visit: <a href="http://www.mitre.org/resources/centers/advanced_info/g04e/cvw.html">www.mitre.org/resources/centers/advanced_info/g04e/cvw.html</a><BR><H3>Netscape's Conference and Collabra  (Patti)</H3>Netscape Conferenceis a real-time multimedia communications tool for Intranet andInternet users. With Conference, one or more users can hold aconference call, share a whiteboard, or conduct a text-based discussion.Conference is based on open standards, so it works with otherreal-time communications tools or Internet phones. Full-duplexaudioconferencing supports clear communications. Collabra DiscussionGroups is an interface for selecting and reading News Groups andreading and sending personal email.<BR><BR>Find addresses online and dial other users with Netscape Communicator'spersonalized address book.  Access online directories to findusers for audioconferencing.  Dial users automatically using DynamicIP addressing.  Access all the features of Communicator's PersonalAddress Book. Send and receive any kind of data, including files,text, and images, in real time.  Conference's shared whiteboardprovides a central location for sharing images.  Chat allows usersto exchange text messages.  File transfer lets users upload anddownload documents and applications during a conference. Sendand receive voicemail messages.  Support for MIME allows Conferenceto send voicemail messages to email addresses.  Support for theWAV voicemail standard ensures that voice messages can be heardwith any open standards-based email program.  Use Conference withother Communicator components.   Integration with Composer's HTMLediting environment allows users to share their own documents.<BR><BR>For more information visit: <a href="http://www.netscape.com/comprod/products/communicator/conference.html">www.netscape.com/comprod/products/communicator/conference.html</a><BR><H3>Electric Communities Microcosm  (Chris)</H3>Electric Communities'first network service, Microcosm, will be a habitat, a graphicalonline community. In a habitat, the customers are representedon the screen by digital puppets called Avatars. Avatars meetin places and talk, play, conspire, build, explore, and have fun.The shared graphical context makes habitats much richer experiencesthan MUDs (multi-user text environments) and chat rooms.<BR>Microcosm will be the first habitat that is user extensible. Customerswill have access to worldbuilding tools with which they will beable to develop their own virtual real estate. This ability increasesthe dynamics of the virtual world, leading to much richer experienceswhen as the most creative customers create things that benefitthe entire community.<BR><BR>For more information visit:  <a href="http://www.communities.com">www.communities.com</a><H3>Microsoft's Net Meeting  (Chris)</H3>This award-winning productprovides the most complete conferencing solution for the Internetand corporate Intranet. Powerful features let you communicatewith both audio and video, collaborate on virtually any Windows-basedapplication, exchange graphics on an electronic whiteboard, transferfiles, use the text-based chat program, and much more.<BR>Using your PC and the Internet, you can now hold face-to-faceconversations with friends and family around the world, and itwon<B>'</B>t cost a fortune to do so! Because NetMeeting 2.0 workswith any video capture card or camera that supports Video forWindows, you can choose from a wide range of video equipment.For the first time, standards-based video, audio, and multipointdata conferencing and collaboration features are integrated intoone, seamless, easy-to-use product.<BR><BR>For more information visit: <a href="http://www.microsoft.com/netmeeting/">www.microsoft.com/netmeeting/</a><H3>Centra Software's Symposium.  (Chris)</H3>Accessed through popularWeb browsers, Symposium takes distance learning to a higher level. Symposium's unique online delivery environment simulates a liveclassroom experience with functions for synchronized viewing ofmultimedia content, real-time audio, text chat, and shared whiteboard.<BR><BR>Body Language (tm) lets participants raise their hands, respondyes or no, and provide instant feedback to the group on the paceand comprehension of the material being presented.  All interactionsare represented in Symposium's graphical Class List, includingnames of participants in the online session. Symposium extendsthis live, online learning experience with capabilities for breakoutsessions, role-plays, labs, group-enabled CBT, and Web Safaris,allowing instructors to guide participants to relevant contenton the World Wide Web during group discussions. <BR><BR> For more information visit: <a href="http://www.centra.com">www.centra.com</a><H3>TeamWave's Workplace (Chris)</H3>TeamWave Workplace is an integratedgroupware solution for Macintosh, Windows, and Unix that letsyou easily and flexibly collaborate and share information withcolleagues across the Internet. By combining real-time groupwaretechnologies such as shared whiteboards, chat rooms, and customizablegroupware applets with a persistent work environment, TeamWaveWorkplace provides shared network places supporting both synchronousand asynchronous collaborations.<BR><BR>The model for Workplace comes from real-life team meeting rooms,which provide a shared space for a workgroup. Team members canbe present in the room at the same time (so they are working togetherin real-time or synchronously), or they may work in the room atdifferent times, but leave things in the room for others (workingasynchronously). Of course, the room can contain any number ofobjects relevant to the team's work.<BR><BR>For more information visit:  <a href="http://www.teamwave.com/">www.teamwave.com/</a><H2><CENTER><FONT SIZE=4>Properties</FONT></CENTER></H2><H3>Accessibility</H3>Is the environment accessible via both low andhigh end technology (e.g. text &amp; graphical)? What's the footprintof the software required (does it require more RAM than many usershave?), and is the cost prohibitive for individuals not part ofan organization using it?. It is accessible via the Internet,or just a LAN? Does it support location independence (the abilityto connect from anywhere) and location transparency (the abilityto work with others without knowledge of their location)?  Canthe system easily achieve critical mass (enough users to enablethem to actually accomplish productive work collaboratively)?<H3>Artifact longevity (&quot;persistence&quot;)</H3>This refers tothe ability of a system to store collaborative artifacts suchas whiteboard notes so that collaborators can later review materialindividually or regroup and continue where they left off. Today'scollaboration tools fall mostly into two categories: those thatare &quot;session-centric&quot;, such as most desktop video teleconferencingsystems, and those that are &quot;document-centric&quot;, suchas Lotus notes and document management systems. These two typesof systems both have some important strengths, but also many weaknesses.Session-centric systems support synchronous collaboration well,but when the session is over, no trace of the collaboration isleft--they don't support persistence. Document centric tools maysupport persistence well, but they poorly support real-time collaboration.<H3>Awareness mechanisms</H3>This property refers to the ability ofa system to inform users when others are active or when criticalevents occur in a shared application. Examples include locationawareness (knowing where others users are), action awareness (knowingwhat they are doing; includes pointing and selecting, notificationof actions, etc.), and view/gaze awareness (what others are seeingor looking at). <H3>Communications architecture</H3>Does the system employ a peer-to-peerarchitecture, a centralized architecture, or a combination (hybrid)of the two? Does it support the exchange of high-level, view-independentobject model descriptions (e.g., so collaborators can simultaneouslyshare and interact with different views of the same object, suchas a graph or a spreadsheet), or just low-level screen sharing? How many participants?<H3>Floor control</H3>This property refers to the ability of a systemto adopt varying models of conversational style, from person-to-personto broadcast to forum style. Is there support for placing andremoving restrictions on who controls the floor, and when?<H3>Interface/metaphor</H3>How well does the system hide complexity?How transparent is its operation? Does it make collaborative interactionsseem as natural as possible? Examples of metaphors that may effectease-of-use include the room-based metaphor, conferencing metaphor,and desktop metaphor. Most collaboration tools either use a conferencing,&quot;session-centric&quot; metaphor (e.g., desktop video conferencingsystems) or a desktop, &quot;document-centric&quot; metaphor (e.g.,document management systems, Lotus notes). These approaches differentiallysupport navigation, real-time collaboration, asynchronous collaboration,memory and use of artifacts, etc. For example, desktop metaphorsmay not support real-time collaboration as well as conferencingmetaphors; conferencing metaphors may not support the developmentof a community memory or artifact. Does the system offer a varietyof interfaces and/or metaphors? How is navigation supported?<H3>Media types</H3>What media types are supported (text, graphics,avatars, video, audio, animations, simulations, Web pages/HTML,HTML with embedded objects such as java applets; word processingformats, etc). Is it easy to add support for new media?<H3>Membership model</H3>Is membership open or restricted? Is therepassword protection? Are there different classes of participants(e.g. wizards, builders, presenters, audience, etc.)?<H3>Modifiability/extensibility</H3>This property refers to the abilityfor users to adapt the technologies to their own needs and uses,to allow social behaviors to rule interactions as appropriateand provide the opportunity for co-development of the technologyand the work activity. Can users create their own objects, changethe interface, add objects in different media forms, etc?</H3><H3>Synchronicity</H3>Does the system support completely synchronous (e.g., audio, Unixtalk), semi-synchronous (chat, MOO), and/or asynchronous (email,bulletin boards, media objects) communication? (Semi-synchronousis often called synchronous, though technically there is a difference.)To what degree are real-time conversations practical within thesystem? To what degree does the system allows messages to be storedand forwarded to another user for later retrieval? Does the systemsupport synchronous editing of documents? Is there support forversion control and locking?<BR><BR><P><H2>References and Recommended Reading</H2><P>Beca, L., Cheng, G., Fox, G.
